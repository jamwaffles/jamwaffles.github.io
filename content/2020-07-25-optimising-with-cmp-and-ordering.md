Welcome to another pointless tangent into the exciting world of line joints in
[embedded-graphics](https://crates.io/crates/embedded-graphics)! `embedded-graphics` is an integer
only, iterator based no-std graphics library for environments with low resource availability. This
time, we'll be looking at some not-so-great optimisations made to a point sorting function.

**Update: A kind Twitter user pointed out a more optimised solution for triangles which you can find
[here](/rust/2020/07/26/perf-addendum.html).**

<!-- more -->

## Some context

I've already covered
[integer-only line intersections](@/2020-07-09-integer-graphics-line-intersection.md), a building
block for computing the corners of both mitered and bevelled line joints. Between then and now, I've
written some test code to triangulate between these computed corners and form a set of thick lines.
Below is an example of a triangle. You can see (if you squint hard enough) the wireframe component
triangles on the left, and the final filled triangle on the right. Looks alright!

![Wireframe triangle with thick stroke](/images/tri-wireframe.png)
![Filled triangle with thick stroke](/images/tri-filled.png)

Now the issue is stroke offsets. Embedded-graphics allows three stroke positions relative to the
theoretical "skeleton" lines of a shape: centered, inside and outside. To ensure the offset remains
on the same side of each edge of the triangle (or polygon), we need to ensure that all points in the
shape are sorted in clockwise order. This allows us to derive the outside lines highlighted in
magenta in the image below:

![Triangle outer edge highlighted](/images/tri-outside.png)

If the points aren't sorted correctly, some lines will flip sides over their length.

## The approach

I'll focus on triangles for this article, but the approach described here should work for any number
of points.

Because embedded-graphics aims to be as fast as possible, it tries to avoid floating point maths
when possible. Conventional triangle sorting algorithms use the dot product of two vectors to
determine order, which typically requires a `tan()` call (I think? What do I look like, a
mathsologist?) so we'll have to find a different solution.

Luckily, there's an integer-only method as described in
[this Stackoverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/6989383/383609) to sort two points by angle.

We can use this sorting function as a predicate to the builtin `sort_unstable_by` method in Rust,
but we need to make a few changes first.

This is the original C(++?) from <https://stackoverflow.com/a/6989383/383609>:

```c++
bool sort_clockwise(point a, point b, point center)
{
    if (a.x - center.x >= 0 && b.x - center.x < 0)
        return true;
    if (a.x - center.x < 0 && b.x - center.x >= 0)
        return false;
    if (a.x - center.x == 0 && b.x - center.x == 0) {
        if (a.y - center.y >= 0 || b.y - center.y >= 0)
            return a.y > b.y;
        return b.y > a.y;
    }

    // compute the cross product of vectors (center -> a) x (center -> b)
    int det = (a.x - center.x) * (b.y - center.y) - (b.x - center.x) * (a.y - center.y);
    if (det < 0)
        return true;
    if (det > 0)
        return false;

    // points a and b are on the same line from the center
    // check which point is closer to the center
    int d1 = (a.x - center.x) * (a.x - center.x) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);
    int d2 = (b.x - center.x) * (b.x - center.x) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);
    return d1 > d2;
}
```

This needs porting to performant Rust, so let's crack on.

## More junk

First, though, we need some supporting code.

Let's say we define a `Triangle` with three `Point`s like this:

```rust
struct Triangle {
  p1: Point,
  p2: Point,
  p3: Point,
}
```

Where `Point` is:

```rust
struct Point {
  x: i32,
  y: i32,
}
```

We need a way to create triangles, and a way to get a triangle with all of its points sorted in
clockwise order. Thus:

```rust
impl Triangle {
    pub fn new(p1: Point, p2: Point, p3: Point) -> Self {
        Triangle { p1, p2, p3 }
    }

    pub fn sorted_clockwise(&self) -> Self {
        let mut points = [self.p1, self.p2, self.p3];

        let center = self.bounding_box().center();

        points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise(*a, *b, center));

        let [p1, p2, p3] = points;

        Self::new(p1, p2, p3)
    }
}
```

Notice the `sort_clockwise` function buried in there? That's what we'll focus on.

> Note: I'm getting the triangle's bounding box and using its center instead of finding the _true_
> triangle "center of gravity" here - it's fast, and good enough for the purposes I need this method
> for.

## Straight port from C/C++ to Rust

This is a syntax port of the original code to Rust. Pretty straightforward.

```rust
fn sort_clockwise_c_port(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -> bool {
    if a.x - center.x >= 0 && b.x - center.x < 0 {
        return true;
    }
    if a.x - center.x < 0 && b.x - center.x >= 0 {
        return false;
    }
    if a.x - center.x == 0 && b.x - center.x == 0 {
        if a.y - center.y >= 0 || b.y - center.y >= 0 {
            return a.y > b.y;
        }
        return b.y > a.y;
    }

    // compute the cross product of vectors (center -> a) x (center -> b)
    let det = (a.x - center.x) * (b.y - center.y) - (b.x - center.x) * (a.y - center.y);
    if det < 0 {
        return true;
    }
    if det > 0 {
        return false;
    }

    // points a and b are on the same line from the center
    // check which point is closer to the center
    let d1 = (a.x - center.x) * (a.x - center.x) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);
    let d2 = (b.x - center.x) * (b.x - center.x) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);

    d1 > d2
}
```

There's not much to mention here other than the fact we're still returning a `bool`. This needs to
be wrapped in a `match` to be usable by `sort_unstable_by` in `Triangle::sorted_clockwise`:

```rust
points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| {
    let order = sort_clockwise(*a, *b, center);

    match order {
        true => Ordering::Greater,
        false => Ordering::Less
    }
});
```

## Changing to use `Ordering`

The above code doesn't feel very Rust-like, but we'll try and fix that better in a bit. For now
though, one good cleanup to make is to stop returning a `bool` and return an `Ordering` directly:

```rust
fn sort_clockwise_use_ordering(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -> Ordering {
    if a.x - center.x >= 0 && b.x - center.x < 0 {
        return Ordering::Greater;
    }
    if a.x - center.x < 0 && b.x - center.x >= 0 {
        return Ordering::Less;
    }
    if a.x - center.x == 0 && b.x - center.x == 0 {
        if a.y - center.y >= 0 || b.y - center.y >= 0 {
            return a.y.cmp(&b.y);
        }
        return b.y.cmp(&a.y);
    }

    // Compute the cross product of vectors (center -> a) x (center -> b)
    let det = (a.x - center.x) * (b.y - center.y) - (b.x - center.x) * (a.y - center.y);

    match det.cmp(&0) {
        Ordering::Less => Ordering::Greater,
        Ordering::Greater => Ordering::Less,
        Ordering::Equal => {
            // Points a and b are on the same line from the center. Check which point is closer to
            // the center.
            let d1 = (a.x - center.x) * (a.x - center.x) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);
            let d2 = (b.x - center.x) * (b.x - center.x) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);

            d1.cmp(&d2)
        }
    }
}
```

That's better! In terms of style, I'm happy with where this is at so I won't change it any futher.
Performance-wise, though, surely we can tune it some more?

## Performance tuning

First, one of the simplest optimisations is present in the original code: don't do work you don't
have to! For example, the `det` variable is only computed if the function falls through to where
it's needed.

Next are some attempts I made at optimising this code a bit better.

## Hoist some comparisons

Recomputing the same thing a few times seems pointless, so I'll hoist the two negations into the
variables `d_ax` and `d_bx` for reuse.

```rust
fn sort_clockwise_hoisted_comparisons(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -> Ordering {
    let d_ax = a.x - center.x;
    let d_bx = b.x - center.x;

    if d_ax >= 0 && d_bx < 0 {
        return Ordering::Greater;
    }
    if d_ax < 0 && d_bx >= 0 {
        return Ordering::Less;
    }
    if d_ax == 0 && d_bx == 0 {
        if a.y - center.y >= 0 || b.y - center.y >= 0 {
            return a.y.cmp(&b.y);
        }
        return b.y.cmp(&a.y);
    }

    // Compute the cross product of vectors (center -> a) x (center -> b)
    let det = (d_ax) * (b.y - center.y) - (d_bx) * (a.y - center.y);

    match det.cmp(&0) {
        Ordering::Less => Ordering::Greater,
        Ordering::Greater => Ordering::Less,
        Ordering::Equal => {
            // Points a and b are on the same line from the center. Check which point is closer to
            // the center.
            let d1 = (d_ax) * (d_ax) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);
            let d2 = (d_bx) * (d_bx) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);

            d1.cmp(&d2)
        }
    }
}
```

## Use `.cmp` and `Ordering` tricks

We've hoisted some calculations, but we can also hoist some of the comparisons into `cmp_ax` and
`cmp_bx`. This also lets us squash everything into one giant `match` block. I'm not sure if it's
easier to read, but it sure is some juicy Pro Rustâ„¢.

```rust
fn sort_clockwise_big_match(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -> Ordering {
    let d_ax = a.x - center.x;
    let d_bx = b.x - center.x;

    let cmp_ax = d_ax.cmp(&0);
    let cmp_bx = d_bx.cmp(&0);

    match (cmp_ax, cmp_bx) {
        // d_ax >= 0 && d_bx < 0
        (Ordering::Greater, Ordering::Less) | (Ordering::Equal, Ordering::Less) => {
            Ordering::Greater
        }
        // d_ax < 0 && d_bx >= 0
        (Ordering::Less, Ordering::Greater) | (Ordering::Less, Ordering::Equal) => Ordering::Less,
        // d_ax == 0 && d_bx == 0
        (Ordering::Equal, Ordering::Equal) if a.y - center.y >= 0 || b.y - center.y >= 0 => {
            a.y.cmp(&b.y)
        }
        (Ordering::Equal, Ordering::Equal) => b.y.cmp(&a.y),
        _ => {
            // Compute the cross product of vectors (center -> a) x (center -> b)
            let det = (d_ax) * (b.y - center.y) - (d_bx) * (a.y - center.y);

            match det.cmp(&0) {
                Ordering::Less => Ordering::Greater,
                Ordering::Greater => Ordering::Less,
                Ordering::Equal => {
                    // Points a and b are on the same line from the center. Check which point is closer to
                    // the center.
                    let d1 = (d_ax) * (d_ax) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);
                    let d2 = (d_bx) * (d_bx) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);

                    d1.cmp(&d2)
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Benchmarking

All benchmarks are run on x64 Linux Mint 20, Ryzen 7 3700X overclocked to 3.8 GHz, 32GB DDR4 3200.
I'm using the venerable [criterion](https://crates.io/crates/criterion) crate to run the benchmarks
and avoid _some_ of the pitfalls when micro-benchmarking.

| Suite                                       | Result (avg) |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Straight C port (baseline)                  | 9.4473 ns    |
| Use `Ordering` instead of `bool`            | 10.712 ns    |
| Hoist some repeated comparisons             | 10.160 ns    |
| Convert everything to a big, single `match` | 12.024 ns    |

Curiously, on x64 at least, all of the nice changes resulted in regressions! Thankfully they're
pretty minor, but it was surprising to see that nothing changed for the better. There's a lot of
rhetoric in Rust optimisation articles about idiomatic code allowing for better optimisations, but
it doesn't seem to apply in this case.

I don't show it here because it'd make the article too long, but I benchmarked a few other triangles
with different properties, and all are sorted at pretty much the same speed.

If you're interested, here's the bench code:

```rust
use core::cmp::Ordering;
use criterion::*;
use embedded_graphics::{geometry::Point, prelude::*, primitives::*};

fn sort_points(c: &mut Criterion) {
    let mut group = c.benchmark_group("sort clockwise");

    let triangle = Triangle::new(
        Point::new(100, 100),
        Point::new(50, 130),
        Point::new(20, 20),
    );

    let center = triangle.bounding_box().center();

    group.bench_function("c port", |b| {
        b.iter(|| {
            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];
            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| {
                let is_greater = sort_clockwise_c_port(*a, *b, center);

                if is_greater {
                    Ordering::Greater
                } else {
                    Ordering::Less
                }
            });
        })
    });

    group.bench_function("use ordering", |b| {
        b.iter(|| {
            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];
            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_use_ordering(*a, *b, center));
        })
    });

    group.bench_function("use ordering stable sort", |b| {
        b.iter(|| {
            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];
            points.sort_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_use_ordering(*a, *b, center));
        })
    });

    group.bench_function("use ordering large set", |b| {
        b.iter(|| {
            let mut points = [
                Point::new(30, 40),
                Point::new(20, 10),
                Point::new(3, 28),
                Point::new(118, 130),
                Point::new(5, 8),
                Point::new(58, 70),
                Point::new(28, 60),
                Point::new(10, 20),
                Point::new(8, 40),
                Point::new(60, 50),
                Point::new(18, 30),
                Point::new(78, 90),
                Point::new(120, 110),
                Point::new(80, 70),
            ];
            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_use_ordering(*a, *b, center));
        })
    });

    group.bench_function("hoisted comparisons", |b| {
        b.iter(|| {
            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];
            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_hoisted_comparisons(*a, *b, center));
        })
    });

    group.bench_function("big match", |b| {
        b.iter(|| {
            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];
            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_big_match(*a, *b, center));
        })
    });
}

criterion_group!(sort, sort_points);
criterion_main!(sort);

```

### Polygons

What's the performance like for shapes with more than three points (i.e. polygons)? That's easy
enough to test with a benchmark with more points in it:

```rust
b.iter(|| {
    let mut points = [
        Point::new(30, 40),
        Point::new(20, 10),
        Point::new(3, 28),
        Point::new(118, 130),
        Point::new(5, 8),
        Point::new(58, 70),
        Point::new(28, 60),
        Point::new(10, 20),
        Point::new(8, 40),
        Point::new(60, 50),
        Point::new(18, 30),
        Point::new(78, 90),
        Point::new(120, 110),
        Point::new(80, 70),
    ];
    points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_use_ordering(*a, *b, center));
})
```

A triangle sorts in about about 4ns per point, however the sort doesn't scale linearly. The above
benchmark with 14 points sorts in about 140ns, or roughly 10ns per point. This will be overhead in
the sorting algorithm, as the sort function itself has a fixed input size.

# Final result

Now triangle points are correctly ordered!

![Clockwise triangle #1](/images/tri-clockwise-up.png)
![Clockwise triangle #2](/images/tri-clockwise-down.png)

Notice the order of `P1`, `P2` and `P3` changes to keep the outside edge on the left of each line.
The only point that is moved between the two screenshots is `P2` in the first (becoming `P3`).

# Conclusion

So, which version is best? Considering they all have about the same performance, I went with
`sort_clockwise_use_ordering`. I think it offers a good balance between readability and performance
(by being basically the same as the naive `bool` C port). If the other methods improved performance
a large amount, I might've gone with the Pro Rustâ„¢ nested `match` with guards, but it's certainly
not easily read.

![You never stopped to think whether you should dot jpeg](/images/should-could.jpeg)

Performance stuff is always worth checking if you're not sure! It's also pretty simple with
`criterion` doing most of the heavy lifting.

That said, always take microbenchmarks with a grain of salt. In this case, that is even more
relevant as architecture differences between the target ARMv7 CPUs embedded-graphics is designed for
and the beefy x64 the benchmarks are running on may have vastly different performance profiles.
Ideally, benchmark on your target hardware if you can.

The final benchmark iteration time is about 10ns on my desktop. This post only discusses part of the
final algorithm, so it does add up, but for now there are bigger fish to fry...

Another thing to do would be to look at the generated assembly. This might be important for
optimising on ARM targets without being able to run benches on the target hardware, but I'll uhh
leave that as an exercise for the reader because I can barely read assembly as it is, let alone grok
the performance of individual instructions.
