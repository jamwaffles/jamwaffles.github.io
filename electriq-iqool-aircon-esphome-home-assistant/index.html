      <h1>Controlling an Electriq iQool AC with ESPHome and Home Assistant</h1>

  <div class="post__text" id="js-post-content"><p>I recently got a pretty neat all-in-one air conditioner to heat my frigid Scottish garage in the
winter. CNC machines don't like the cold, and neither do I! My unit is an &quot;electriQ iQool 12000 BTU
Wall Mounted Air Conditioner with Heating Function&quot;, product code <code>IQOOL-SMART15HP</code>. I quite like
it, but when I got it I <em>really</em> wanted to be able to shout at Siri to turn the garage heat on so
it'd be warmer by the time I went out. And I succeeded in this mission! By flashing ESPHome to the
integrated Tuya TYJW2S-5V-YA module, I can now control this AC perfectly from Home Assistant and, by
extension, Apple's Home app.</p>
<span id="continue-reading"></span><h1 id="investigation"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#investigation" aria-label="Anchor link for: investigation">Investigation</a></h1>
<p>TL;DR skip to <a href="https://wapl.es/electriq-iqool-aircon-esphome-home-assistant/#esphome-configuration">the ESPHome config</a></p>
<p>There is vanishingly little documentation for the iQool online, so figuring out some of the finer
details of this guide took a long time and/or a lot of trial and error. But. It turns out this unit
is almost identical to the Qlima
<a href="https://www.qlima.com/monoblock-airco-cooling-and-heating-wdh-229-ptc-white.html">&quot;Monoblock airco cooling and heating WDH 229 PTC white&quot;</a>.
I read a press release quoting the Electriq CEO saying he goes to the factories that produce
whitelabelled units for other manufacturers and buys a bunch straight from the source, so this makes
sense.</p>
<p>Knowing these units are very similar, this was incredibly useful information as the
<a href="https://perfion.pvg.eu:7003/Perfion/file.aspx?id=12529765-f6f1-4b24-8bd6-085c9e94f7df">WDH 229 PTC datasheet</a>
mentions Tuya support. At last! After ages of searching I've found the key piece of information I
need!</p>
<p>Do you know what else contains this key piece of information? The long section of the iQool manual
already in my posession that came with my electriQ iQool 12000 BTU Wall Mounted Air Conditioner with
Heating Function dedicated to setting up the Tuya app. There goes several hours of my life paid in
stupid tax...</p>
<p>Anyway, ESPHome has Tuya compatibility and can talk to Home Assistant, so let's flash that to the
Wifi module and get much more functionality through HA's fancy home automation. I'll remind you that
my goal is to shout at Siri to turn on the garage AC (in heat mode because I live in Scotland come
on). Success will be had.</p>
<p>The lower level control functions of the aircon are controlled by another microcontroller, so as far
as I know there's not too much risk in flashing ESPHome or your own firwmare to the Wifi module.
This other microcontroller also exposes various datapoints to the WiFi module like the measured
temperature which is nice to be able to report back to Home Assistant.</p>

<p>I'm including this section for those who want a solution that doesn't require either replacing the
Tuya firmware or can't open the unit to flash the module.</p>
<p>ESPHome can spoof infrared remote controls, so I started there. Doing some debugging with
<a href="https://github.com/crankyoldgit/IRremoteESP8266">IRremoteESP8266</a>, the protocol seems to <em>almost</em>
be <code>TROTEC_3550</code> but more often than not the tool just ended up decoding the remote data as
<code>Pronto</code>, a generic IR waveform encoding format.</p>
<p>I did get the unit working over IR with Home Assistant using ESPHome's <code>remote_transmitter</code>
component but it felt quite brittle to me sending raw Pronto codes. I also wanted to read data back
from the AC which obviously isn't possible with a one way IR link, so I moved on to slightly more
involved hacks.</p>
<p>Please let me know if you'd like the Pronto codes - I still have the working ESPHome config floating
around somewhere.</p>
<h1 id="firmware-flashing-connections-for-the-the-tyjw2s-5v-ya-tuya-module"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#firmware-flashing-connections-for-the-the-tyjw2s-5v-ya-tuya-module" aria-label="Anchor link for: firmware-flashing-connections-for-the-the-tyjw2s-5v-ya-tuya-module">Firmware flashing connections for the the TYJW2S-5V-YA Tuya module</a></h1>
<p>This <a href="https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/tyjw2s5vbl?id=Kaax48319lsfq">module</a> is a small
breakout board for the
<a href="https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/wifie1smodule?id=K9605thnvg3e7">TYWE1S</a> system on module (or
whatever you want to call it).</p>
<p>The way I flashed the first ESPHome firmware does require physical access to the WiFi module, but it
may be possible to hack it over the air by following
<a href="https://devices.esphome.io/guides/tuya-convert">the ESPHome <code>tuya-convert</code> guide</a>. I was
comfortable taking my unit apart but if you're not, you should still have an options in that guide.
That said I'm glad I did crack into my unit as the heat exchanger coil was missing screws! That's
what you get for buying B-grade I guess. Once ESPHome is flashed once and connects to your WiFi
successfully, you should be able to flash much more easily OTA.</p>
<p>You'll need a serial adapter to hook onto the wifi board. I used a
<a href="https://wiki.sipeed.com/hardware/en/logic_analyzer/combo8/index.html">Sipeed Slogic Combo8</a> but any
serial adapter will work.</p>
<p>Once the case is removed, the Tuya module is in a black plastic case on the top left of the unit
(red arrow in photo below). Unscrewing this is tricky without small screwdrivers as the heat coil is
in the way, but is doable. Once the module is removed, you'll need to open the snapped together
plastic case to reveal the module inside.</p>

<p>The Tuya TYJW2S-5V-YA
<a href="https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/iot/tyjw2s5vbl?id=Kaax48319lsfq">datasheet</a> shows the pinout as
the following:</p>

  <img src="https://wapl.es/processed_images/tuya-pinout.7074b583f770c2e0.png" />
</div>
<p>The lower 4 pins are the interface to the aircon control MCU. The pins up the side (<code>TXD0</code>, <code>RXD0</code>,
etc) is the programming/debug header. I'm going to use the unit's power from the 4 pin connector, so
I only connected TXD0, RXD0 and GND to my serial adapter.</p>
<p>I got a bit... inventive with the wiring.</p>

<h2 id="flashing-process"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#flashing-process" aria-label="Anchor link for: flashing-process">Flashing process</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Plug in AC unit</li>
<li>Unplug the 4 pin connector on the WiFi module</li>
<li>On your PC/laptop, run whatever command you want to send to the module, e.g. <code>esphome run ac.yaml</code>
or <code>esptool.py</code></li>
<li>Hold the single button on the module,</li>
<li>Plug the 4 pin connector to the AC back into the module to repower it, then release the button.
This puts the module in programming mode.</li>
<li>The <code>esphome</code>/<code>esptool.py</code> command should start communicating now. You might have to try this
process a few times to get the command to bite as the timeouts are quite short.</li>
</ul>
<p>Once ESPHome is flashed, you can update much more easily over the air.</p>
<h2 id="optional-back-up-the-original-firmware"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#optional-back-up-the-original-firmware" aria-label="Anchor link for: optional-back-up-the-original-firmware">Optional: back up the original firmware</a></h2>
<p>For safety's sake I took a backup of the original Tuya firmware by following
<a href="https://community.blynk.cc/t/how-to-backup-restore-official-firmware-on-any-espressif-esp8266-esp32/34309">this guide</a>.
Make sure you have <code>esptool</code> installed (usually installed with <code>esphome</code> I think). My device has a
2MB flash. Here are the commands I used:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash z-code"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="z-source z-shell z-bash"><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-function z-shell">esptool.py</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell"> --</span>port</span> /dev/tty.usbmodem103 flash_id</span>
</span><span class="z-source z-shell z-bash"><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-function z-shell">esptool.py</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell"> -</span>b</span> 115200<span class="z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell"> --</span>port</span> /dev/tty.usbmodem103 read_flash 0x000000 0x200000 electriq-iqool-tuya-2m.bin</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>And to write the original firmware back to the device if you need to:</p>
<pre data-lang="bash" class="language-bash z-code"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="z-source z-shell z-bash"><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-function z-shell">esptool.py</span></span><span class="z-meta z-function-call z-arguments z-shell"><span class="z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell"> -</span>b</span> 115200<span class="z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell"> --</span>port</span> /dev/tty.usbmodem103 write_flash<span class="z-variable z-parameter z-option z-shell"><span class="z-punctuation z-definition z-parameter z-shell"> --</span>flash_freq</span> 80m 0x000000 electriq-iqool-tuya-2m.bin</span>
</span></code></pre>
<p>Don't forget to change the port to whichever one you're using!</p>
<p>The original firmware for my unit can be downloaded <a href="/files/electriq-iqool-tuya-2m.bin">here</a> if you
need to reset to defaults. Do so at your own risk, however. I bear no responsibility for any damage
or bricking of your unit.</p>
<p>The IR remote is still usable with ESPHome, and its state is propagated through to HA which is nice,
however the state on the remote itself can't be updated externally, so any actions sent from the
remote will clobber any settings in HA, meaning things like temperature setpoint and mode will all
be changed to match the remote if you change the fan speed for example. Ah well, your phone is the
remote now!</p>
<h1 id="esphome-configuration"><a class="zola-anchor" href="#esphome-configuration" aria-label="Anchor link for: esphome-configuration">ESPHome configuration</a></h1>
<p>The ESPHome configuration is pretty standard, although I did have to use some not-yet-merged (at
time of writing) features made available in <a href="https://github.com/esphome/esphome/pull/5159">this PR</a>.
I had to fork that repo again
<a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles/esphome/tree/fix_tuya_climate_updates">here</a> with some
<a href="https://github.com/jamwaffles/esphome/commit/90e37a8e101e977decaa22d215bd0576a077dceb">fixes</a> to
get the changes to compile with an updated ESPHome.</p>
<p>With luck, by the time you're reading this you can just use the <code>tuya</code> component straight from
ESPHome, but for now, I'm going to use this config:</p>

<p>This setup has been working flawlessly. I'm really happy I can reuse all original firmware for a
super clean hack - it's just software! The only thing I couldn't get working is the PTC heater in my
unit. Apparently this is only controllable through the remote as I didn't find any Tuya datapoints
that changed when I enabled/disabled the PTC.</p>
<p>For future reference, here are the mappings I determined by mashing buttons on the remote and
looking at the log output:</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Datapoint</th><th>Function</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td>1</td><td>On/off (standby)</td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>Target temperature in ºC</td></tr>
<tr><td>3</td><td>Current measured temperature in ºC</td></tr>
<tr><td>4</td><td>Mode (cool <code>0</code>, fan <code>1</code>, dry <code>2</code>, heat <code>3</code>)</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>Fan speed (<code>0</code> low, <code>1</code> medium, <code>2</code> high)</td></tr>
<tr><td>101</td><td>&quot;Sleep&quot; (quiet mode) preset on/off</td></tr>
<tr><td>104</td><td>Vertical swing on/off</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<p>And here's what I was reading through from the ESPHome output:</p>

<p>I'm curious to know what the bitmasks are - maybe defrost state, errors, something else? Who knows!
But they were <em>always</em> zero when I inspected them. If I can be bothered, I'll grab some logs when
the unit is in defrost mode and see if anything changes.</p>
