thumbv7m-none-eabi architecture used in\nembedded. This post is a collection of examples of attempted code size reductions by refactoring\nsometimes the most tiny of functions. It will hopefully serve as a reference to both me and you,\ndear reader, in your travels through the Rust lands.\nI don't have much knowledge of the deeper bits of the optimisation pipeline in both LLVM or Rust, so\nthese experiments are probably super obvious to anyone with an inkling, but it was a good learning\nexperience for me either way so I thought I'd share.\n1. Clamp length offsets to the buffer length\nGodbolt\nThis is code that will quite happily panic for what it's worth. The skip function is part of a\nlarger set of uh \"generator-combinator\" functions (generate stuff instead of parsing it like nom)\nand will jump over a given number of bytes in the provided buffer, returning the rest.\n\nskip3 seems to be the best here. If the returned buffer length is zero, the other original code\nthat uses it will panic instead so we've probably just moved the assertion check in the wide program\nthan removed it entirely.\n2. Idiomatic method chaining is smarter than you think\nGodbolt\nFewer lines really is faster!\n\nThe two latter solutions produce identical assembly, so there's no need for unsafe here - the\nperformance is already there.\nThere's also an in-between if you find a lot of chained methods hard to read, which is\nunderstandable:\n\nAgain, identical assembly as the two above.\n3. (currently) nightly: slice_first_last_chunk\nGodbolt\nThis PR will soon stabilise some methods that make\nparsing integers from slices much more pleasant, but do they help with performance?\n\nThe methods all generate the same assembly.\n4. Another scenario\nGodbolt\nAlright now I'm just impressed. The two following functions generate the same assembly both for x64\nand thumbv7m-none-eabi.\nNote that the first function is copied from the output of cargo expand - it's generated by a proc\nmacro derive, therefore is pretty terrible code. But the optimiser doesn't seem to care.\n\nunpack_from_slice_new is prettier if that matters. Either way it's nice to see that prettier code\ndoesn't make for worse code.\n4. Pointer offsets just turn into numbers\nGodbolt\nAs you might expect, but it's nice to have the confirmation. Original code is this:\n\nThis just turns into\n\nBecause both byte_adds are given constants.\n5. Converting Duration into u64 nanoseconds isn't that bad\nEtherCAT uses nanosecond time everywhere, stored as a u64.

None of this pertains to real firearms.\nI have a G&amp;G P90 (in tan, in case you were wondering) and like many others suffer from the hicap\nmags failing to feed. Half filling them kind of works, but the feed mechanism always seems to jam.\nI've got a half solution here in this article. It doesn't completely fix the problem, but my hicaps\nfeed a lot more reliably now, particularly in semi-auto, than they did before.\n\nThis fix works by supergluing a couple of BBs into strategic places in the mag to agitate the BBs\nand make them fall into the feed mechanism more reliably.\nFirst, crack open your mag by unscrewing every sccrew you can find. The mag has an outer shell and\nan inner box, both of which you'll need to open. None of the internals should spring out, take care\nduring this step.\nStopping 'back jamming'\nI had problems where BBs would roll back into the feed wheel and cause it to jam. I fixed this by\nsupergluing a BB into a spot in the mag like this:\n\nThe feed roller on the left rotates clockwise and must make sure the BB clears the spokes on the\nwell so it can turn freely. About half a BB's width between the spokes and your glued BB is what you\nshould aim for.\nAgitating BBs\nThis is perhaps the more effective mod, and it should ensure BBs are fed into the spoked feed wheel\nbetter as they usually have a tendency to clump up from the spring pressure of the mag. I solved\nthis using half a BB glued to the pre-feed wheel.\nI cut a BB in half with some sidecutters and filed it smooth on the bottom so glue would bond\nbetter:\n\nI then glued it near the center of the pre-feed wheel (gear on the right) like this:\n\nScrew the mag back together (don't forget the filler hatch) and you should be good to go. It's quite\ndifficult to break a mag using this method as the BBs can be snapped or sanded out if necessary,\njust don't glue any of the gears or wheels!\nAs with all stuff like this, your mileage may vary. This mod has worked out ok for me although I do\nstill get some jams which are cleared by shaking the mag back and forth or giving it a good whack on\nthe top.

But motion\ncontrollers are hard, even with the right books, so I did what any good programmer would do:\nprocrastinate by implementing an entire industrial fieldbus protocol instead! Say hello to\nEtherCrab - a pure Rust EtherCAT controller that supports\nLinux, macOS, Windows and even no_std.\nHeads up! EtherCrab 0.4.0 was released in March 2024 with some breaking changes. Why not head over\nto the announcement post to see what's new?\n\nAre you looking to use Rust in your next EtherCAT deployment? Experiencing jitter or latency issues\nin an existing EtherCrab app? I can help! Send me an email at james@wapl.es\nto discuss your needs.\n\nA quick primer on EtherCAT\nFeel free to skip this section if you're already familiar with EtherCAT.\nIf you're new to EtherCAT, here's a quick high level\noverview:\n\nIt is a very widely supported and used industrial fieldbus protocol pioneered and standardised by\nBeckhoff.\nIt uses the Ethernet physical layer (i.e. cables and connectors) for good compatibility, but\ndescribes its own packet structure on top of Ethernet II frames to cater to EtherCAT's needs\naround latency and topology.\nIt is designed for realtime systems with cycle times down into the microseconds if desired\nThere is one controller (\"master\" in EtherCAT terminology)\nOne or more devices (\"slaves\") are connected in a long chain, so have at least two ports: input\nand output.\nEtherCAT packets are sent along the entire chain in a fixed traversal order, then sent all the way\nback to the controller, allowing devices to read and write data to packets addressed to them.\nPackets are read/written during their transit through each device meaning latencies are in the low\nhundreds of nanoseconds per device range.\nCyclic process data is sent in one 4GB address space. Devices are configured by the controller to\nread from/write into specific pieces of this address space.\n\nThere are other bits of the protocol and many extensions available, but the above hopefully gives a\ndecent introduction to the basics. I've also found the\nEtherCAT Device Protocol poster\na good starting point for further learning.\nPrior art\nThere are many EtherCAT controller solutions out there already, two of which are the Etherlab\nIgH master as well as\nSOEM. These are battle-tested EtherCAT controllers\nand there are even Rust wrappers for both, so why didn't I just pick one and use it?\nC. They're written in C.\nAnd I like Rust. A lot. More seriously though, human, physical, electrical and ATEX safety (among\nothers) is critical in many industrial applications, so why are we still writing the control\nsoftware behind these systems in an unsafe, easy to misuse language? Let's fix that!\nOf the solutions I looked at in detail, SOEM seemed like a good choice for me as it provides a lower\nlevel interface, which is what I was looking for. After working through some code and even getting a\nservo drive running, I pretty quickly decided the world needed a Rust implementation instead.\nSOEM, like many C libraries, is frustrating to work with. It has very little documentation and\nexample code, along with a C API which is just a pile of functions in a trench coat. The\nRust wrapper is quite thin and leaks a lot of the C-ness through,\nso it didn't help much.\nEtherCrab was borne out of these frustrations. I was looking for an open, safe, ergonomic EtherCAT\ncontroller and couldn't find one that was particularly well suited to the Rust ecosystem. One\nEtherCAT membership application later, and here we are.\nA motivating example\nWith our brief history lesson over, let's see EtherCrab in action with a quick example.\nThis code is taken from\nhere. It\ninitialises the EtherCAT network and assigns the discovered devices into two groups. Groups are an\nEtherCrab concept, and allow concurrent tasks to update different parts of the process data image\n(PDI) at different rates. For example, a machine in a factory might have some digital IOs polled at\na \"slow\" 10ms, and a servo drive cycle at 1ms. Groups are Send so can be run concurrently in\ndifferent threads.\nThis example targets Linux, but should work on macOS and even Windows as long as the weird NPcap\ndriver is setup correctly.\nMore examples can be found in\nthe examples/ folder in the repo.\nYou can also find a no_std example using Embassy\nhere.\nFirstly, some imports as is tradition.\n\nOne import of note is std::tx_rx_task. This is a ready-made function that creates a future which\nhandles all network communications. This would be switched out for something else if a different\nnetwork driver is used, or for a mock if writing tests. EtherCrab provides building blocks to make\nwriting your own networking adapters as easy as possible.\nNext, because EtherCrab statically allocates all its memory using const generics, it needs to know\nsome details about how much storage it should be given. We could use magic numbers where required,\nbut let's give these values sensible names so we know which numbers mean what.\n\nNext up is PduStorage. This is where all network packets are queued and held while waiting for a\nresponse. Because this example uses tokio, which requires Send + 'static futures, we'll make a\nstatic instance called PDU_STORAGE. If you're using scoped threads or a more relaxed executor,\nthis could be an ordinary let binding in main.\nPduStorage contains unsafe code, but is carefully designed and checked to contain it, whilst\nproviding a safe API on top. PduStorage has no public API, but its creation is handled by the end\napplication so as to control the lifetimes of the data it hands out.\n\nWe'd like multiple groups so let's define a struct to give them names. This could be a tuple\ninstead, but the indexes can get confusing so we'll use a struct.\n\nLet's begin our app code by starting the TX/RX task in the background, along with creating a\nClient. The Client is the main handle into EtherCrab and is what any application code should\nuse.\n\nIf different network machinery is used, tx and rx would be passed into custom code to drive\nthem.\nWe're going to need the client in two tasks, so we'll wrap it in an Arc to allow it to be\nclone()d. The methods on Client are &amp;self allowing concurrent usage without any kind of mutex\nor lock. EtherCrab was designed from the start to be thread safe.\n\nNow we'll initialise the EtherCAT network. client.init() will assign an EtherCAT \"Configured\nStation Address\" to each device, read their EEPROM configurations and set up the sync managers and\nFMMUs ready for configuration and communication.\ninit() takes a closure that must return a reference to a group the current device will be added\nto. In this example, we match on the device name but other identifiers or application-specific logic\ncould be used.\nOnce init returns, we will have two groups with all devices in PRE-OP state.\n\n\nℹ️ If only one group is desired, we could forego the Groups struct and use\nclient.init_single_group instead:\n\n\nNow we'll create a clone of the client (well, the Arc that wraps it) so we can pass it to a second\ntask. Again, we don't need a lock or mutex because the methods on Client are &amp;self, Client is\nSync, and EtherCrab's internals are thread safe.\n\nNow we come to the application logic. This will most often be a loop with a set delay in it to\ndefine the cycle time for the group.\n\nPay attention to the loop { ... }, specifically:\n\nThis is the cyclic application logic. The code in this example does some low level bit twiddling\nbut this is where more complex logic can be performed, as long as the computation time doesn't\nexceed the cycle time. If it does, you'll get stalls or hitches in the output.\nThe tx_rx method must be called every cycle otherwise the group's data will not be sent or\nreceived!\ntick().await internally compensates for the execution time in each loop iteration, so there's\nno need to handle this manually.\n\nNow we can spawn the other \"fast\" task which just increments each byte of the outputs of each device\nin this group's PDI (Process Data Image).\n\nNow we can start both tasks concurrently, exiting if one of them errors out.\n\nError handling and a few other lines have been omitted from this walkthrough for brevity. The full\nexample can be found\nhere.\nEtherCrab's design\nEtherCrab is async-first and supports Linux, macOS and Windows but please, for your sanity, target\nLinux. macOS at a push. There is also no_std support as EtherCrab makes heavy use of const\ngenerics to remove the need for an allocator. You can find an embedded example using\nEmbassy\nhere, although other\nruntimes should work great too, like RTICv2.\n\n\nOn initialisation, EtherCrab scans the EtherCAT network and assigns a Configured Station Address to\neach discovered device. Two options are then available: a single group can be created with all\ndevices in it, or multiple groups can be created, allowing different devices to have different\nbehaviours during operation. A device is always owned by only one group.\nEtherCAT devices must be transitioned through various operational states before they can operate\nwith cyclic application data. EtherCrab leverages Rust's strong type system to only allow method\ncalls that are valid for the current state of a group. For example, the tx_rx method which\ntransfers the group's PDI is only callable in SAFE-OP or OP as this functionality is invalid in\nany other state. This makes the API simpler to use, and removes most of the footguns I found when\ntrying out SOEM.\n\nThread safety and ownership\nThe PDU loop is the single place where writable data is stored. It contains the only unsafe code\nin the crate, and has checks, careful design and uses atomics to ensure that packet buffers are only\never loaned to one owner. This means that the PDU loop is Sync, allowing Client to also be\nSync, so can be used safely by multiple threads or tasks running their own process cycles.\nA lot of EtherCAT controllers let you do whatever you want with the PDI which is flexible, but isn't\neven close to safe. Concurrent writes and other potential race conditions erode confidence in what\nis actually sent to the device.\nBy leveraging Rust's strong type system and borrow checker, EtherCrab prevents this issue from\nhappening almost entirely at compile time. There is a single runtime check using an\natomic_refcell::AtomicRefCell when getting a reference to a device in a group, but performance is\notherwise unaffected when accessing the PDI.\n\nA good concise example of this deliberate safety in the API is the group.tx_rx().await call:\n\nBecause tx_rx() is &amp;mut self, no references to any devices may be held while their underlying\nPDI data is read/written over the network. This completely removes the possibility of a race\ncondition entirely at compile time with no performance penalty.\nUse in non-async contexts\nThe example shown earlier uses tokio and a lot of async/await. This can be a problem if:\n\nThe application around EtherCrab isn't async and/or\nYou need more control over the threads that each task runs in for jitter or latency reasons\n\nIf your application (std or even no_std) does not use async, EtherCrab's methods can be wrapped\nin functions that block on the returned future, making it a sync API.\nHere's an example of a small blocking application using smol::block_on. It spawns a thread in the\nbackground to run the TX/RX task.\n\nRunning EtherCrab this way does give more control over thread priority and placement. For example,\non a realtime system we can use the\nthread_priority crate to set the priority of the TX/RX\nthread:\nE.g.\n\nPerformance\nTests on both of my dev machines, as well as those of a client using EtherCrab in production, have\nshown that with a little bit of system tuning an extremely consistent process data cycle of 1000us\nis achievable using smol in a SCHED_FIFO thread. Network latencies are\nlow and predictable, and timing jitter from smol's timer is miniscule which is great to see for\nsuch an easy to use API.\nA small benchmark in\nexamples/jitter.rs is\navailable to see how your system performs. It prints statistics every few seconds, so doesn't give\nmuch insight but is still useful.\nI've also created some tools in dump-analyser\nwhich ingests Wireshark packet captures into a Postgres database for further analysis. Please note\nthat at time of writing it is very rough but it's already proven invaluable when checking results\nof system tuning in Linux.\nConclusion\nGive EtherCrab a try, and do reach out via\nGithub issues or\nMatrix if you get stuck!\nEtherCrab is in a pretty good state already - you may have noticed the 0.2.x version if you visit\nit on crates.io - and I'm proud to say it is already in\nproduction use! That said, there are still many features to implement, including FSoE (Functional\nSafety over EtherCAT), MDP (Modular Device Profile) for easier communication with servo drives, and\nother extensions.\nIf you want to use EtherCrab but it doesn't currently provide functionality you need, please\nopen a feature request!\nI've really enjoyed working on EtherCrab to both scratch my own itch, and hopefully help others at\nthe same time. If you're interested in seeing where it goes or in helping expand Rust's industrial\nautomation footprint, please give it a star, share it\nwith anyone who might find it interesting/useful, and try it out! I'm always looking for guinea pigs\nto see what EtherCrab might be missing, or what oddware it refuses to work on.\nWe're on Matrix too, so come and hang out if chatting\nabout industrial automation (Rust or not) is your kind of thing.

From the manual, ensure that\njumper W1 is in the UP position.\nFor reference, here's an image of the breakout cable:\n\n  \n  \n\nSoldering up the jog wheel connector\nWe now need to solder a DB25 connnector to the jog pendant cable so it can be plugged into the Mesa\ncard.

You\ncan find them at linuxcnc-hal (high-level interface) and\nlinuxcnc-hal-sys (low-level interface). The rest of\nthis post is a getting started tutorial, so follow along if you have a cool idea for a custom bit of\nCNC hardware and an itch to write the interface in Rust!\n\nLinuxCNC is a popular, open source machine controller. It's very powerful\nand is an excellent way to get into CNC on an absolute budget. LinuxCNC is also expandable with\ncustom components called HAL components or HAL comps.\nUp to now, most components are written in C or Python. Pretty unsafe or slow - these languages don't\nmake the best choice for a potentially heavy/dangerous/fast machine! With its safety and low to zero\noverhead, Rust is a prime replacement for writing HAL comps, however there doesn't seem to be any\nway to integrate Rust with LinuxCNC... until now!\nThere are\nexamples for\nboth, but\nlet's go through making a HAL component step by step!\nA primer on HAL components\nLinuxCNC has the concept of a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). The HAL allows (among other things)\ncustom components to be loaded at startup which hook into the HAL using virtual \"pin\"s. These pins\nallow comps to take inputs from LinuxCNC and provide outputs to it. A HAL component is often used to\ncommunicate with custom hardware such as VFDs, toolchangers or information readouts.\nA HAL component is a normal binary with a standard main() function, however there are certain\ncomponent-specific actions that must be taken to hook it into LinuxCNC. The two crates mentioned\nabove (linuxcnc-hal and\nlinuxcnc-hal-sys) facilitate this linking in Rust.\nHello world\nLet's write a basic component with one input and one output pin to get a feel for the interface. Set\nup a binary project and add linuxcnc-hal as a dependency:\n\n\nYou might need to install cargo-edit if cargo add\nisn't found:\ncargo install --force cargo-edit\n\nThe code described below should go into src/main.rs.\nFirst, we need some imports. Both the input and output are going to accept f32 values, so we'll\nuse HalPinF64. Other types\nare available.\n\nMoving onto main(), we need to change the signature slightly as the component is going to return a\nResult for better error handling. Replace any existing main() with this:\n\nNow let's populate main(). First, a HalComponentBuilder needs to be created. This is the first\nthing that should happen as it registers the component with LinuxCNC's HAL and gets an ID assigned\nto it. In this example, we'll register a component called hello-comp. This is equivalent to a call\nto hal_init() in C land.\n\nNext, we need some pins. We'll create one input and one output called input-1 and output-1\nrespectively. These are the HAL pin names you'll see in LinuxCNC.\n\nOnce the pins are registered, the builder can be consumed into a complete HAL component. This step\nsignals to LinuxCNC that the component has registered all pins and is ready to use. It's important\nto note that LinuxCNC will hang if ready() isn't called. In C land, you'd call hal_ready()\nat this point.\n\nHAL pins can't be registered after ready() is called in a component, and we take care of that with\nRust's type system and the type state pattern. The\nbuilder.ready() call above consumes the builder into a HalComponent which doesn't have any way\nto register pins on it, preventing invalid operation order. In a C HAL component, an error is logged\nif you do register a pin after the ready() call and probably lands you in an invalid state. It's\nobviously a lot safer to capture that error at compile time, so we'll let Rust's rich type system\nhelp out here. Yay Rust!\nAnyway, now we're initialised, let's start the main control loop of the component. We'll check\ncomp.should_exit() every iteration to see if a Unix signal has been received from LinuxCNC asking\nthe component to quit.\n\nThis simple loop sets the output-1 pin's value to the current elapsed time in seconds every\niteration. It also prints the value of input-1 to the console. If you hook input-1 up to, say,\nthe spindle.0.speed-out pin in a .hal file, you should see the spindle RPM value printed to the\nconsole.\nSo as not to lag LinuxCNC up too much, we call thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)) to\npoll/update the pins every second. This delay can be made shorter for a more responsive component.\nAn emergency stop control would need to respond much faster than 1 second!\nThe above loop will cycle forever until a SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGKILL signal is received.\nLinuxCNC will send one of these on shutdown, ending the loop. Once the loop is over the component\nshould exit with a success status. Add the following to the bottom of main():\n\nAt this point in C, you'd have to remember to call hal_exit. Not too hard, but it's possible to\nforget. With linuxcnc-hal there's a custom Drop impl for HalComponent. It automatically calls\nhal_exit for you when it goes out of scope at the end of the program. Rust lets us be lazy and\nsafe. Noice.\nIf the above is difficult to follow, here's the complete and final src/main.rs:\n\nWith any luck, running cargo build will successfully compile your new component. cargo run is\nunlikely to work, as the raw hal_* functions aren't defined by the crate. They're defined in\nliblinuxcnchal.so which is loaded by LinuxCNC.\nLoading into LinuxCNC\nI'm assuming some basic knowledge of how the LinuxCNC HAL is configured in this section. If you need\na primer, the official LinuxCNC docs are a good place to\nstart. I'm also assuming you have a LinuxCNC config ready to go, either a simulator or a real\nmachine.\n\nDisclaimer: I do not accept responsibility for any loss or injury caused by following this\ntutorial with real hardware. CNC can be dangerous. Use your common sense.\n\nRunning cargo build will create a binary artifact at ./target/debug/hello-comp. We now need to\nhook this into LinuxCNC and wire some pins up using a .hal file.\nTo create a basic .hal config, add the following to hello-comp.hal in the crate root.\n\nThe config first loads the component into userspace. We're not creating a realtime component here.\nIt then creates a net called input-1, joining spindle.0.speed-out to the input pin\nhello-comp.input-1.\nAdd this to your machine .ini config like so:\n\nYou might get some pin conflicts on startup, so if LinuxCNC crashes check the error messages and fix\nany conflicting pin errors in your .hal files.\nStart LinuxCNC as you normally would. Note that you'll need to run it from the console to see the\ninput pin value printed. With luck, you should see pins.input-1 and pins.output-1 under the\nPins tab of Machine -&gt; Hal Meter. Select pins.output-1 and you should see the current\nelapsed time in seconds.\nFinal Thoughts\nRust's type safety and ownership rules mean we get a safe, easy to use interface to the underlying\nLinuxCNC HAL methods.\nThere's still a lot more left to do on linuxcnc-hal. There isn't a way to register signals yet,\nand a lot of the\nautogenerated methods don't\nhave a safe wrapper yet. That said, hopefully the pins-only interface is useful to see where the\npain points/bugs are in linuxcnc-hal.\nThanks for reading, and happy machining!\nIf you found this article or linuxcnc-hal itself useful, please consider\nbecoming a Github sponsor.

CNC machines don't like the cold, and neither do I! My unit is an \"electriQ iQool 12000 BTU\nWall Mounted Air Conditioner with Heating Function\", product code IQOOL-SMART15HP. I quite like\nit, but when I got it I really wanted to be able to shout at Siri to turn the garage heat on so\nit'd be warmer by the time I went out. And I succeeded in this mission! By flashing ESPHome to the\nintegrated Tuya TYJW2S-5V-YA module, I can now control this AC perfectly from Home Assistant and, by\nextension, Apple's Home app.\nInvestigation\nTL;DR skip to the ESPHome config\nThere is vanishingly little documentation for the iQool online, so figuring out some of the finer\ndetails of this guide took a long time and/or a lot of trial and error. But. It turns out this unit\nis almost identical to the Qlima\n\"Monoblock airco cooling and heating WDH 229 PTC white\".\nI read a press release quoting the Electriq CEO saying he goes to the factories that produce\nwhitelabelled units for other manufacturers and buys a bunch straight from the source, so this makes\nsense.\nKnowing these units are very similar, this was incredibly useful information as the\nWDH 229 PTC datasheet\nmentions Tuya support. At last! After ages of searching I've found the key piece of information I\nneed!\nDo you know what else contains this key piece of information? The long section of the iQool manual\nalready in my posession that came with my electriQ iQool 12000 BTU Wall Mounted Air Conditioner with\nHeating Function dedicated to setting up the Tuya app. There goes several hours of my life paid in\nstupid tax...\nAnyway, ESPHome has Tuya compatibility and can talk to Home Assistant, so let's flash that to the\nWifi module and get much more functionality through HA's fancy home automation. I'll remind you that\nmy goal is to shout at Siri to turn on the garage AC (in heat mode because I live in Scotland come\non). Success will be had.\nThe lower level control functions of the aircon are controlled by another microcontroller, so as far\nas I know there's not too much risk in flashing ESPHome or your own firwmare to the Wifi module.\nThis other microcontroller also exposes various datapoints to the WiFi module like the measured\ntemperature which is nice to be able to report back to Home Assistant.\nQuick aside: IR remote spoofing kinda works\nI'm including this section for those who want a solution that doesn't require either replacing the\nTuya firmware or can't open the unit to flash the module.\nESPHome can spoof infrared remote controls, so I started there. Doing some debugging with\nIRremoteESP8266, the protocol seems to almost\nbe TROTEC_3550 but more often than not the tool just ended up decoding the remote data as\nPronto, a generic IR waveform encoding format.\nI did get the unit working over IR with Home Assistant using ESPHome's remote_transmitter\ncomponent but it felt quite brittle to me sending raw Pronto codes. I also wanted to read data back\nfrom the AC which obviously isn't possible with a one way IR link, so I moved on to slightly more\ninvolved hacks.\nPlease let me know if you'd like the Pronto codes - I still have the working ESPHome config floating\naround somewhere.\nFirmware flashing connections for the the TYJW2S-5V-YA Tuya module\nThis module is a small\nbreakout board for the\nTYWE1S system on module (or\nwhatever you want to call it).\nThe way I flashed the first ESPHome firmware does require physical access to the WiFi module, but it\nmay be possible to hack it over the air by following\nthe ESPHome tuya-convert guide. I was\ncomfortable taking my unit apart but if you're not, you should still have an options in that guide.\nThat said I'm glad I did crack into my unit as the heat exchanger coil was missing screws! That's\nwhat you get for buying B-grade I guess. Once ESPHome is flashed once and connects to your WiFi\nsuccessfully, you should be able to flash much more easily OTA.\nYou'll need a serial adapter to hook onto the wifi board. I used a\nSipeed Slogic Combo8 but any\nserial adapter will work.\nOnce the case is removed, the Tuya module is in a black plastic case on the top left of the unit\n(red arrow in photo below). Unscrewing this is tricky without small screwdrivers as the heat coil is\nin the way, but is doable. Once the module is removed, you'll need to open the snapped together\nplastic case to reveal the module inside.\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nConnections\nThe Tuya TYJW2S-5V-YA\ndatasheet shows the pinout as\nthe following:\n\n  \n  \n\nThe lower 4 pins are the interface to the aircon control MCU. The pins up the side (TXD0, RXD0,\netc) is the programming/debug header. I'm going to use the unit's power from the 4 pin connector, so\nI only connected TXD0, RXD0 and GND to my serial adapter.\nI got a bit... inventive with the wiring.\n\n  \n  \n\nFlashing process\n\nPlug in AC unit\nUnplug the 4 pin connector on the WiFi module\nOn your PC/laptop, run whatever command you want to send to the module, e.g. esphome run ac.yaml\nor esptool.py\nHold the single button on the module,\nPlug the 4 pin connector to the AC back into the module to repower it, then release the button.\nThis puts the module in programming mode.\nThe esphome/esptool.py command should start communicating now. You might have to try this\nprocess a few times to get the command to bite as the timeouts are quite short.\n\nOnce ESPHome is flashed, you can update much more easily over the air.\nOptional: back up the original firmware\nFor safety's sake I took a backup of the original Tuya firmware by following\nthis guide.\nMake sure you have esptool installed (usually installed with esphome I think). My device has a\n2MB flash. Here are the commands I used:\n\nAnd to write the original firmware back to the device if you need to:\n\nDon't forget to change the port to whichever one you're using!\nThe original firmware for my unit can be downloaded here if you\nneed to reset to defaults. Do so at your own risk, however. I bear no responsibility for any damage\nor bricking of your unit.\nThe IR remote is still usable with ESPHome, and its state is propagated through to HA which is nice,\nhowever the state on the remote itself can't be updated externally, so any actions sent from the\nremote will clobber any settings in HA, meaning things like temperature setpoint and mode will all\nbe changed to match the remote if you change the fan speed for example. Ah well, your phone is the\nremote now!\nESPHome configuration\nThe ESPHome configuration is pretty standard, although I did have to use some not-yet-merged (at\ntime of writing) features made available in this PR.\nI had to fork that repo again\nhere with some\nfixes to\nget the changes to compile with an updated ESPHome.\nWith luck, by the time you're reading this you can just use the tuya component straight from\nESPHome, but for now, I'm going to use this config:\n\nNext we'll configure logging. Because the AC MCU talks over the UART normally used for logging\n(UART0), we have to disable that, OR use UART1 (the TXD1 pin on the module):\n\nFor additional debugging, we can hook up the LED on the module as a status blinker. This is\noptional, or can at least be removed when you're sure everything is working.\n\nNow we need to set up UART0 to communicate over the 4 pin connector:\n\nAnd enable the tuya component with no additional config:\n\nNow for the real magic: our climate component!\n\nThe next part is optional, but if you'd like to log AC state/data in something like Grafana, you'll\nneed to add some sensors:\n\nFinal words and some additional details\nThis setup has been working flawlessly. I'm really happy I can reuse all original firmware for a\nsuper clean hack - it's just software! The only thing I couldn't get working is the PTC heater in my\nunit. Apparently this is only controllable through the remote as I didn't find any Tuya datapoints\nthat changed when I enabled/disabled the PTC.\nFor future reference, here are the mappings I determined by mashing buttons on the remote and\nlooking at the log output:\nDatapointFunction\n1On/off (standby)\n2Target temperature in ºC\n3Current measured temperature in ºC\n4Mode (cool 0, fan 1, dry 2, heat 3)\n5Fan speed (0 low, 1 medium, 2 high)\n101\"Sleep\" (quiet mode) preset on/off\n104Vertical swing on/off\n\nAnd here's what I was reading through from the ESPHome output:\n\nI'm curious to know what the bitmasks are - maybe defrost state, errors, something else? Who knows!\nBut they were always zero when I inspected them. If I can be bothered, I'll grab some logs when\nthe unit is in defrost mode and see if anything changes.\n\n","id":"https://wapl.es/electriq-iqool-aircon-esphome-home-assistant/","title":"Controlling an Electriq iQool AC with ESPHome and Home Assistant"},"https://wapl.es/electronics/rust/2018/04/30/ssd1306-driver.html/":{"body":"As part of the\nweekly driver initiative, myself\n(@jamwaffles),\n@therealprof and @scowcron\nhave been working on\na Rust driver for the common as mud SSD1306-based OLED display modules.\nThis little chip is found in the majority of inexpensive OLED display modules found on Ebay and\nAliExpress. It supports either an SPI or I2C interface, both of which the driver supports.\n\nThe driver currently supports two modes:\n\nGraphicsMode, a buffered mode\nfor drawing text, shapes, pixels and images\nTerminalMode, a bufferless\nmode to draw text to the display\n\nThe easiest way to get started with either mode is to use the\nBuilder. Here's an example that connects\nover I2C and draws some shapes in GraphicsMode for the STM32F103:\n\nFirst, we need to set up the I2C interface. This is pretty standard HAL boilerplate:\n\nYou'll need to change this code to work with the device you're using. I'm running the I2C1 interface\nat 400KHz in the example above.\nNext, let's create a display instance, initialise it and clear the display:\n\nThis is where we use the\nBuilder pattern to construct\na driver that will talk to the display over I2C. By default, the builder returns a\nRawMode driver which isn't\nvery useful on it's own unless you just want to draw raw pixels. To be able to do more useful\nthings, we'll call .into() which will convert the driver into a richer mode defined by the type of\ndisp. In this case, we want to use GraphicsMode&lt;_&gt; to be able to use all the goodness from the\nembedded_graphics crate.\nThe last step is to initialise and clear the display with disp.init() and disp.flush() (graphics\nmode has an empty display buffer by default).\nNow we can draw some stuff to the display:\n\nThis will draw a triangle, square and circle in roughly the middle of the display.\n\nBufferless\nBecause GraphicsMode is buffered, you need to call disp.flush() to write the buffer to the\ndisplay. It also consumes 1KiB of RAM to hold the buffer which is quite a lot of memory for a µC!\nAnother supported mode is\nTerminalMode,\nimplemented by @therealprof. TerminalMode is an unbuffered\ncharacter output mode that renders only text. It draws from left to right and top to bottom,\nrestarting in the top left corner. It uses a built-in 7x7 font on a fixed 8x8 pixel grid.\nAside from writing raw strings to the display, this mode also supports the core::fmt::Write trait\nso you can call any of the usual Rust output and formatting methods/macros on it. While useful, be\naware that doing so will add a lot of bloat to your binary.\nHere's a small \"Hello World!\" example for the STM32F103, using the SSD1306 via I2C:\n\nYou can find the full example\nhere.\nThere's currently no positioning or scrolling support beyond calling\nclear(),\nbut this mode provides a lighter alternative to a full, buffered GraphicsMode.\nOnwards\nPlease give the driver a try! There are\na bunch of examples in the repo which\nshould be a good starting point. They contain device-specific initialisation code, but the driver\ncode itself is agnostic, so they should provide a good starting point. The driver should be pretty\nusable on most systems, but there's a plethora of hardware out there, some combinations of which\nmight not work.

Please note that it\ncurrently doesn't use the internal memory of the IC as the display buffer, so could be\nmemory-optimised quite a lot. PRs welcome!\nThe driver currently only supports I2C as I haven't seen many SPI SH1106 modules in the wild, so\nlet's take a look at the code to hook up the display over I2C. I'll draw the Rust logo as seen in\nthe header image in the following example.\nI've left some of the boilerplate out of this code, but you can find the\ncomplete example here.\n\nComplete, runnable example\nSimple as that!

There are\na few examples that should Just Work on\nan STM32 Blue Pill, but it would be great to test this crate on other devices as well.

Elm. It's been an interesting experience for me, coming from a procedural language (JS)\nbackground. The learning curve is steep, but the functional nature of Elm, along with its compile\ntime type safety really pays off. One of the (few!) problems I've found as a newcomer however, is\nthat the documentation can be really frustrating sometimes. In this post, I hope to remedy that\nslightly by providing a newcomer's perspective on a little bit of data processing in Elm.\n\nHeader photo by @rawpixel\nLet's say I've collected a list of tags from questions on StackOverflow. I want to create a unique\ndictionary of tags and the number of times they occur in the dataset. To do that, we'll need to\nprocess the data from a flat list into a Dict of key/value pairs. The key will be the name of the\ntag, and the value will be the number of occurrences in the dataset.\nStarting at the beginning (whoa)\nFirst, let's just render this List of tags:\n\nCool. We'll store that list in a Model to pass to some rendering layer:\n\nThis will store the list of tags under model.tagList, which we can use in the view to render a\n(not so) pretty list:\n\nThe entire program so far is shown below. It's a pretty standard Elm boilerplate app. The most\ninteresting bits are described above; how we store the list, and how we present it.\n\nGreat, we've got a working Elm program. Next, I'll go into a bit of data processing to turn this\nflat, boring list into a Dict of tags and counts.\nDicts\nAs a first step towards grouping the data, we need to start using a Dict. Dicts contain unique\nkeys with an associated value. They're the same as Map()s in JavaScript. As a first step we'll\njust render a list of unique tags to keep things understandable. The counts will come later.\nFirst, the model type needs to change to use an Elm Dict for our list of tags:\n\ntagList is now of type Dict String Int, which is a map of String keys to Int values. This\nwill hold the tag -&gt; count mapping.\nWe need to write a function to transform the list of tags when the model is initialised, so let's\nwrite that:\n\nThis function will foldr (Array.reduce() in JavaScript parlance) the tag list and create a\nDict. The keys will be the unique list of tags from the input, while the values at the moment\nwill all be 0 for simplicity's sake.\nThe |&gt; is some syntactic sugar. The above is the same as this:\n\nThe |&gt; operator \"fills in\" the last argument of List.foldr function with tags.\n\nA quick aside: in\nthe docs for foldr\nyou'll see a signature that looks like this:\n\nThis is frustratingly obtuse for a beginner (or at least was for me), so let's rename the\nvariables to make it a bit clearer:\n\nThe example in the docs is foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3] == 6. I found this pretty confusing, although\nit's wonderfully concise. Rewritten in longer form, it's a bit more understandable:\n\nHope that helps!\n\nAnyway, now we can initialise the model:\n\nFinally, we can change our render method slightly:\n\nAgain, the |&gt; could be written like this:\n\nYou can see that using the\npipeline operator makes things\nmuch easier to read. Here's a demo:\n\nCounting keys\nThis Dict isn't very useful without some actual data in its keys. To fix that, we need to update\ngroupTags to actually count the number of occurrences instead of just setting each value to 0.\nHere's what it looks like:\n\nInstead of overwriting existing keys with Dict.insert as before, we're now using Dict.update\nwhich takes three arguments:\n\ntag – they Dict key to search for\nupdateFunc – how to update the Dict\ndictToUpdate – the starting Dict we want to update\n\nIt's important to note that Dict.update will upsert a key; if it doesn't exist, it'll get\ncreated. Dict.update returns a whole new Dict, with the updated/inserted key/value pair. This is\nwhere the second argument (updateFunc) comes into play. It is supplied with one argument,\nexistingCount, which is a Maybe type. If there's no existing key, this will be Nothing,\notherwise you'll get Just &lt;dict value type&gt;. In our case, this would be Just Int. The case\nstatement will add one to an existing value, or insert a new key into the dict with a starting value\nof 1.\nThe last thing we need to do is update the view to render tag counts:\n\nUnfortunately this is a bit involved, because Dict.map takes a Dict, therefore must return a\nDict. We want to return a List of &lt;li&gt; elements, so we can't directly use Dict.map. Argh.\nSo first we turn the Dict into a list of tuples with\nDict.tolist. The data now\nlooks like this:\n\nCool, now it's in a list so we can turn that into a bunch of &lt;li&gt; elements with List.map:\n\nBecause this code is looping through a list of tuples, we need to use Tuple.first and\nTuple.second to extract the tag and count respectively. The last bit is to call toString on the\ncount to turn the Int into a String, ready for outputting in HTML.\nNow we've got something that looks like this:\n\nAnd we're done! Well done if you made it down here.\nWrapping up\nHopefully I've helped you understand a bit about how data processing (particularly with Dicts)\nworks in Elm with some practical code. During my Elm learning experience, I found there was a gap\nbetween absolute beginner tutorials and more advanced stuff. Perhaps that's my procedural background\ntalking, or perhaps I just need to be smarter. Who knows, but either way the aim of this article was\nto help bridge this gap. Let me know on Twitter if there's\nsomething I can do to improve this article, and as always, thanks for read'n.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/elm/2017/12/12/elm-counting-occurrences.html/","title":"Elm: counting groups of items in a list"},"https://wapl.es/esp32-tlc5940-rmt/":{"body":"The TLC5940 is a \"16-channel LED driver w/EEprom dot\ncorrection &amp; grayscale PWM control\" IC, used for driving up to 16 constant current outputs\n(typically LEDs) using a number of control lines. It's more complex to drive than the\nTLC5947 which uses a simple I2C interface, but leaves more\ncontrol to the application developer by letting them set the LED PWM frequency, among other things.\nThe TLC5940 uses SPI to transfer brightness data, but also requires an external PWM clock, as well\nas a periodic pulse on the BLANK pin to ensure the outputs remain enabled. This is annoying to do in\nsoftware, but by abusing the RMT peripheral in an ESP32, we can let the microcontroller hardware do\nall of the heavy lifting for us.\n\nPlease note that I'm not going to detail the full TLC5940 setup in this post (e.g. SPI, XLAT, etc).\nThat said, if you'd like a complete example using Embassy, I've left a bunch\nof code at the bottom of this post.\nBehaviour from the datasheet\nLet's take a quick look at the timing diagram in the\nTLC5940 datasheet page 14:\n\n  \n  \n\nIt's a little hard to make out, but paying attention to the BLANK and GSCLK signals, we see the\nIC requires 4096 pulses on GSCLK followed by a high pulse on BLANK. GSCLK is the PWM clock\nsource for the IC, so no outputs will be enabled if it's absent. For some reason, BLANK needs a\npulse every 4096 cycles to get the IC to continue functioning. We'll pay attention to the timing\nrequirements later.\nHardware options\nWhile we could of course use loops and counters to manually toggle the BLANK and GSCLK pins,\non ESP32 there's a really nice peripheral called the\nRMT (Remote Control Receiver)\nwhich:\n\nThe RMT (Remote Control Transceiver) peripheral was designed to act as an infrared transceiver.\nHowever, due to the flexibility of its data format, RMT can be extended to a versatile and\ngeneral-purpose transceiver, transmitting or receiving many other types of signals.\n\nWe don't care about receiving anything, but we can use the two transmit channels of the RMT to\ngenerate the pulse trains we need. The RMT is configured by specifying high or low pulses of varying\nduration. The key reason to use the RMT is it can be set up to repeat its configured pulse train\nwithout any intervention in code, freeing the MCU up for other business logic tasks.\nChannel configuration\nWe'll configure channel 1 for the GSCLK waveform. The RMT only allows a few pulses to be provided,\nbut we can use the carrier frequency generation block of the RMT to generate a high frequency PWM\nsignal on the output while in an \"on\" pulse. All we need to do then is provide an \"on\" pulse with a\nduration of 4096 cycles to generate the correct number of GSCLK pulses.\nThe timing diagram from above shows that GSCLK must be disabled while the BLANK pin is high, so\nwe'll specify a second \"off\" pulse to disable the carrier while we perform the BLANK pulse on\nchannel 2.\nChannel 2 of the RMT will be for the BLANK pulse, and behaves as the inverse of channel 1, however\ndoes not require the carrier to be enabled as we don't want a high frequency clock on the BLANK\npin.\nSynchronising the channels\nThe RMT can be told to synchronise both its channels. This is important for our use case to ensure\nthe BLANK pulse lies in the idle period between GSCLK pulse trains.\nSome code\nI'm using the ESP HAL for its\nnice high level API, but at the end of the day all we're doing is writing register values, so the\nfollowing solution should work in any software stack. Also, I'm using an ESP32-C3 but I believe the\nRMT is available in most/all Espressif ICs.\nHere's the RMT configuration in full:\n\nThis code is a bit of a handful and difficult to understand, but the visualisations in the next\nsection should hopefully clarify what the configuration is doing.\nBefore that though, I'll draw attention to a couple of things:\n\nThere isn't yet a high level API to enable channel sync, so I'm dropping down into the\nPAC (Peripheral\nAccess Crate) to manually set some bits.\nWe call transmit_continuously to repeat the configured pulse train indefinitely.\nThe blank_spacing variable adds some gaps around the BLANK pulse. I'll discuss this in\nTighter timing below.\n\nBehaviour\nHere's what we see in PulseView, a logic analyser GUI:\n\n  \n  \n\nWe can see a repeating pattern of high frequency PWM (the grey mess), interrupted by a BLANK pulse\non the other line.\nIf we zoom in to the end of a cycle, just before the BLANK pulse, Pulseview shows us that 4096\npulses have been sent:\n\n  \n  \n\nIt also confirms the desired 1MHz frequency:\n\n  \n  \n\nNow let's turn out attention to the BLANK pulse:\n\n  \n  \n\nWe can see it's nicely separated from the GSCLK pulse train, and is suitably long for the IC to\nregister it.\nTighter timing\nLet's take a closer look at the timing around the BLANK pulse:\n\n  \n  \n\nThe code in this post is extremely conservative, meaning we're leaving performance on the table,\nand potentially introducing undesirable flicker in any attached LEDs. We can probably do better,\nstarting by figuring out what the datasheet specifies as \"better\". Looking at the timing diagram\nabove, it makes reference to several excitingly named parameters like th4,\ntwh3, etc. The values for these times are defined in the datasheet section \"6.3\nRecommended Operating Conditions\". I'll copy the relevant ones for BLANK timing here:\nMinimum time\nth4Hold time GSCLK ↑ to BLANK ↑10ns\ntwh3BLANK pulse duration10ns\ntsu4Setup time BLANK ↓ to GSCLK ↑10ns\n\nA minimum of 10ns. Nice. Are we near these minimums?\n\n  \n  \n\nLol. Not even close. Here's the minimum times against what we configured:\nMinimum timeOurs lmao\nth4Hold time GSCLK ↑ to BLANK ↑10ns16500ns\ntwh3BLANK pulse duration10ns32031ns\ntsu4Setup time BLANK ↓ to GSCLK ↑10ns16500ns\n\nWe're 3 orders of magnitude safe, so I think we can probably do better in our RMT configuration. The\nmaximum frequency on GSCLK is 30MHz, although I don't think the RMT can reach even half that\nfrequency (remember, the GSCLK pulse train is at half the RMT peripheral clock), but we could\nsimply bump the RMT peripheral clock as an easy step in the right direction.\nThe better option would be to reduce blank_spacing in the example code from above, as well as\nfiddling with the BLANK pulse duration. This is RMT clock dependent however, so I'll leave it as\nan exercise to the reader.\nA full example\nHere's an example using Embassy which just fades all outputs up and down in a\nloop:\n\n","id":"https://wapl.es/esp32-tlc5940-rmt/","title":"Rust: Running a TLC5940 with an ESP32 using the RMT peripheral"},"https://wapl.es/ethercat-sii-eeprom-checksum/":{"body":"This is an answer to\nthis StackExchange question which I'm posting\nhere instead as I refuse to add any more of my time or energy to that website.\nI'm using Rust and the crc crate to calculate the checksum of the\nfirst 14 bytes of an EtherCAT SubDevice EEPROM.

These terms were changed by\nthe ETG recently to \"MainDevice\" and \"SubDevice\".The EtherCrab crate itself hasn't yet made this\ntransition, but will be doing so in a future release. This article uses \"MainDevice\" to refer to the\nEtherCrab Client and \"SubDevice\" to refer to a Slave or SlaveRef.\nLast thing I promise\nAre you using EtherCrab in production or even just as a hobby? I'm collecting testimonials, so\nplease let me know if you are! I'd love to know where and how EtherCrab is ending up!\nI can be reached via james@wapl.es,\n@jamwaffles on Mastodon or\n@jam_waffles on Twitter. Do say hello!\nRighto, onto the snazzy new features.\nDistributed clocks\nFirst up, Distributed Clocks (DC) support. I'm really proud of this feature because DC is complex to\nimplement and verifying correct operation is challenging, but I got through all that, and EtherCrab\nnow has support for Distributed Clocks! It's currently being used in the field and has solved a\nbunch of problems the user was having with their servo drives without DC enabled, which was great\nto see.\nA quick intro to Distributed Clocks\nIf you're not familiar with EtherCAT's Distributed Clocks functionality, I'll give a quick intro\nhere. Feel free to skip ahead if you don't need the refresher.\nDistributed Clocks, or DC for short, is a fantastic part of EtherCAT that compensates for the fact\nthat the clocks in every device in the network suffer from drift, phase noise and incoherence\nrelative to each other. It is able to do this by designating a specific SubDevice as a reference\nclock and distributing (hah) that timebase across the network, taking into account propagation\ndelays as well as continuously compensating for drift. EtherCAT networks with DC enabled can\nsynchronise all SubDevice input and output latching to well within 100ns of each other if desired.\nA SubDevice is much more likely to have a cleaner clock than the MainDevice as it doesn't suffer\nfrom OS noise like software interrupts, multiple CPU power states, core swapping and the like. This\ncleanliness is distributed to all other SubDevices, absolving the network of nearly all jitter,\nglitches or latency from the MainDevice when it transmits the PDI (Process Data Image).\nA lot of applications don't need levels of timing this accurate (e.g. reading sensor data every half\na second is pretty relaxed) but for SubDevices like servo drives in Cyclic Synchronous Position\nmode, it is vital to have a regular point in time where inputs and outputs are sampled. If the\ntiming is even a little irregular, the drive can error out, or even cause damage to the plant.\nAnother common use case for DC is synchronising multiple axes of motion. If the outputs of each axis\nare not latched at the same time, deviations from the planned trajectory can occur. The global DC\nsync pulse coordinates these actions regardless of network size.\nWith DC, a SubDevice will buffer the PDI until the next DC sync cycle (SYNC0 pulse), at which time\nit will latch the input/output data. This gives a window of time in which the MainDevice can jitter,\nstall or go on smoko before it sends the next PDI without the SubDevice having to care, as long as\nthe MainDevice sends the PDI before the next SYNC0 pulse.\nDC in EtherCrab\nAs an example of the best possible performance, EtherCrab is capable of sub-10ns coherence between\ntwo SubDevices. The plot below shows the SYNC0 falling edge of two SubDevices aligned to within ~7ns\nof each other. The green trace exhibits a small amount of jitter as real life is never perfect, but\nstill, seven nanoseconds!\n\n  \n  \n\nThe MainDevice (EtherCrab) is responsible for repeatedly sending synchronisation frames to keep all\nSubDevice clocks aligned, as well as ensuring the Process Data Image (PDI) is sent at the right time\nwithin the DC cycle.\nEtherCrab's new tx_rx_dc method will handle sending the sync frame alongside the PDI, but also\nreturns a CycleInfo struct containing some timing data that can be used to establish a consistent\noffset into the process data cycle. Here's an example using smol timers:\n\nThis example configures a 5ms DC cycle time, and will produce delay values that allow the MainDevice\nto send the PDI 2.5ms or 50% into the cycle. You can find a more complete example\nhere.\nDC is tricky to get right, so the example is quite long.\nIt's important to use smol::Timer::at (or equivalent for your executor/blocking code) instead of a\nnaive delay to compensate for variable computation times in the loop. With the above code, we can\nachieve extraordinarily low jitter from the MainDevice that fits well within the established DC\ncycle:\n\n  \n  \n\nIf you decide not to use the next_cycle_wait parameter, or you use tokio, the jitter will\nlook a lot worse. Notice the varying pulse offset on the cyan trace, as well as the atrocious\nstandard deviation of nearly 300us:\n\n  \n  \n\nIf you would prefer not to use async timers, I'd recommend the[timerfd crate]\n(https://docs.rs/timerfd/latest/timerfd/) to get best timing accuracy. std::thread::sleep is also\nan enticing option for its simplicity, but is a poor choice due to it not taking into account the\nloop or network processing time.\nio_uring\nThe Linux kernel introduced a new way of doing IO a while back called io_uring. It's touted as a\nmore perfomant way to do IO by using a pair of ringbuffers to reduce copies and overhead in the\nsystem.\nEtherCrab 0.4 adds support for io_uring using the blocking tx_rx_task_io_uring function. This is\nsimilar to tx_rx_task, however the latter is async and requires an executor to run.\ntx_rx_task_io_uring should be spawned into a new thread so as to not block the rest of the\napplication.\nAsync performance with smol is pretty solid, but for really tight timing, or applications with\nshort process data cycles, io_uring can reduce the TX/RX overhead, leaving a bit of breathing\nroom.\nAdditionally, because io_uring doesn't rely on an executor that might spawn other threads, we get\ncontrol over where the TX/RX driver is placed. For example, you might want to pin it to a core with\na specific realtime priority for best network performance. With an executor like smol or tokio,\nyou're at the mercy of that crate's thread creation and placement.\nHow it works\nWhichever network driver is used, it needs to be efficient. Because EtherCrab is fully async\ninternally, we can use the Waker machinery provided by Rust to notify the driver when a frame is\nready to be sent, and allow it to sleep when no work needs to be done.\nWhen the io-uring driver has been woken and the frame has been sent, it will busy-poll the response\nring so as to not introduce unnecessary latency. This is a bit inefficient, but network packets are\nreturned quickly enough that in reality not much time is spent busy looping.\nIf no more frames are ready to send, we simply call thread::park() to put the thread to sleep\nuntil unpark() is called by a custom Wake trait implementation. Doing a bit of monitoring with\nhtop shows basically no CPU usage with a 1ms process data cycle which is great!\nWhat we've done is essentially make a quite rigid, hyper specific futures executor that is tailored\nto our needs, namely latency and io-uring-ness. But. It works really well. I'll also add that it's\nnot too difficult to write your own executor if there are some specific requirements you need.\nCustom derives\nEtherCrab 0.4 brings with it two new crates:\n\nethercrab-wire\nethercrab-wire-derive\n\nGetting data safely into and out of a process data image has been a challenge in EtherCrab so far,\nlargely relying on the user to add something like packed_struct. This is ok, but quite confusing\nbecause EtherCAT is little endian, which packed_struct doesn't handle that well. The new crates\nlisted above provide a first-party, EtherCAT-tailored solution to this. The traits\nEtherCrabWireRead, EtherCrabWireReadWrite and EtherCrabWireWrite as well as #[derive]s for\neach are provided to make it easier to get named structs and other typed data into and out of\nEtherCrab.\nHere's a quick example using the derives:\n\nThe traits are documented as experimental, however EtherCrab uses them internally and they've been\nworking very well so far. There are already a\nbunch of type impls\nso it should just be a case of hooking them together in a struct for your application.\nBut why?\nEtherCrab used to use a lot of packed_struct internally, however I was never happy with it. I\ncould not for the life of me get the byte/bit orders to where I could use sequential bit offsets.\nFor example, a 2 byte struct with 16 1 bit fields would require the use of bit indices like 8..15\nfor the first 8 fields, then 0..7 for the last 8, because EtherCAT is little endian. I might\njust be holding packed_struct wrong, but it's also overcautious in its API, with nearly everything\nreturning a Result, and no real way of telling the compiler some things are infallible. With these\nreasons in mind, I decided to write my own replacement.\nOther solutions exist that use getters and setters, but due to how many different fields always need\naccessing within EtherCrab, I didn't want to add that level of noise to the code. They might be\nslightly more performant, but EtherCrab spends nearly all of its time waiting for the network\nanyway...\nSafety over performance\nAs a subscriber to the great idea of the pit of success, these derives are meant to be as safe and\neasy to use as possible. This means things like zeroing out buffers before writing to them, and\nfallibly unpacking fields when decoding with length checks.\nIf you need to get rid of this overhead, #[repr(packed)] is always available, but more of a pain\nto use both correctly and safely.\nHonourable mention: multi-PDU sends\nIf two or more EtherCAT frames needed to be sent at once, EtherCrab 0.3.x would send these in two\nseparate Ethernet frames. This is inefficient and became an issue when DC support was added. DC\nrequires a sync frame to be sent alongside the PDI, and in 0.3.x this means doubling the amount of\npackets sent over the network, potentially tanking performance.\nEtherCrab 0.4 now sends this sync frame next to the PDI frame, reducing overhead and improving cycle\nlatencies.\nThere are other places in EtherCrab that don't yet use this functionality, but they're less\nperformance sensitive than the application process data cycle.\nConclusion\nEtherCrab 0.4 is the culmination of hundreds of hours of research, implementation and testing. It's\nfull of improvements and some really useful new features as discussed above, and I'm really happy to\nsee this stuff released!\nThe time it takes to develop also costs me money. If you'd like to see continued development on\nEtherCrab, I'd really appreciate you becoming a\nGitHub sponsor. I quit my job to work on EtherCrab, and\ncould really use the support!\nEither way, do please check out EtherCrab 0.4.0 on\ncrates.io, lib.rs or\nGitHub.\nThe wire helpers crate is available here, and finally, why not\ntake a look at some examples to\nget your Rust EtherCAT journey started?\nIf you get stuck, open an issue or\nsay hi on Matrix.

I'll go over some of the bigger features in this post, and for the full changelog you\ncan check it out here. The\nMSRV has been bumped from 1.77 to 1.81.\nSubDevice group PDI spinlocks\nAs of 0.6, the Process Data Image (PDI) for each SubDevice group is wrapped in a spinlock. This\nrelaxes some of the API so that SubDevices can be safely shared between tasks/threads now, however\nwhen locks are involved, deadlocks are also much more likely. As a general rule, try to hold the\nPdi*Guard returned by SubDevice::{io_raw, outputs_mut, ...} for as little time as possible and\nif you need to persist the PDI somewhere, copy it into other memory like a struct, Vec or array.\nThe lock and EtherCrab API is designed in such a way that the PDI state is always consistent. This\nmeans that all SubDevices will always see the same iteration of the PDI, which is important when the\nPDI is sent over the network in multiple EtherCAT frames. In this case, the group TX/RX call will\nonly release the PDI lock when all frame responses have been received. Conversely, if a SubDevice\nis reading from or writing to its PDI, the TX/RX operation for the next cycle will wait for all\nSubDevices to release the PDI lock.\nIt's tempting to only lock the part of the PDI storage that's currently being updated (either from\nthe application or received frame), however this risks some SubDevices in the group observing the\nnext frame's data, whilst others will see the current frame or vice versa. EtherCAT strives to\nproduce a temporally accurate representation of the real world, so allowing partial state\nobservations is antithetical to that goal. The locks in EtherCrab are designed to uphold this goal.\nThe PDI lock is scoped to each group, so running multiple groups with different cycle times is still\nfine and a supported/desired use case.\nSubDevice status now read during TX/RX\nPrior to this release, reading the SubDevice status for all devices in a group was cumbersome and,\nmore importantly, slow. It required writing a loop to send multiple separate EtherCAT frames without\na good way to parallelise the network traffic.\nThis is now vastly improved by making the SubDeviceGroup::tx_rx* methods pack SubDevice status\ncheck EtherCAT frames into the same Ethernet packet as the PDI, if there's space left. If there\nisn't, another packet will be sent with as many status check frames packed into it as possible\nresulting in minimal extra network traffic for up to 128 status checks (if memory serves correctly).\nThis process continues until all SubDevice status check frames have been sent.\nFor small to medium networks, it's quite likely that no additional network layer traffic will be\nsent as the PDI and status check EtherCAT frames will all fit in a single Ethernet packet.\nTo make use of this extra data, the tx_rx* methods now return a TxRxResponse struct. This is a\nbreaking change to the tuple returned before, but it is a much more flexible API which EtherCrab can\nuse more in the future. Here's a short example of running a process data cycle and checking\nSubDevice statuses all in one operation:\n\nWindows\nEtherCrab used to provide the tx_rx_task async function for Windows users for consistency with the\nasync function of the same name offered for Linux and macOS, however this is removed in 0.6 as the\ninternals of the function are all blocking anyway, and it doesn't make sense to add async executor\noverhead to running the TX/RX task. Now, instead of spawning an async task to run the TX/RX loop,\nyou should thread::spawn the tx_rx_task_blocking function. It is also recommended to use\nsomething like thread-priority and other tricks in the\nEtherCrab Windows tuning guide\nto improve performance on Windows. It'll never be as good as something like Linux - don't expect\n100us cycle times! - but the tricks in that guide do help timing consistency quite a lot.\nOther stuff\nA few EEPROM methods were added which now allows things like dumping of EEPROMs using EtherCrab (see\nexample here) and\nreading/setting the SubDevice alias address.\nIt's now possible to read/write SDO sub indices using arrays, for a bit less typing in configuration\ncode. For example:\n\nA couple of the variants in Error have been removed as they're no longer returned by any EtherCrab\ncode, and a couple of new ones have been added like Error::Mailbox(MailboxError::Emergency).\nThe rest of the changelog is largely filled with reliability and robustness improvements. For\nexample, EtherCrab's internal storage is slightly more resilient to race conditions, and SubDevice\ninitialisation is a lot more reliable when the EEPROM is empty or only partially populated.\nWhat's next\nWhile these aren't solid commitments, I thought I'd quickly list some other stuff I'd like to see in\nEtherCrab in the next release anyway:\n\n\nA primitive API to bypass EtherCrab's automatic SubDevice configuration. Currently, EtherCrab\nrelies on a SubDevice's EEPROM being properly populated, which is becoming less and less good as\nEtherCrab is used on more SubDevices where this isn't the case. Most EtherCAT MainDevice\nimplementations rely on ESI files or similar static configuration methods. ESI files are even\nrequired for SubDevice certification, so they're probably a lot more reliable as a config source.\nAs a step towards ESI file support, I'd like to expose a reasonably nice way to set explicit\nconfiguration for FMMUs and Sync Managers, completely bypassing the EEPROM autoconfig. This should\nallow extremely basic support for ESI files too, leading me onto my next feature.\n\n\nSome kind of more ergonomic way to map a SubDevice's PDO configuration into its slice of the PDI\nusing the config described above. This could be a precursor to a derive macro which does a bunch\nof magic to automatically configure and map a SubDevice's PDI from its ESI file, but I think a\nfirst pass should be more basic with no magic.\n\n\nThe above features should also allow the creation of a high level DS402 interface for servo drives\nand other motor drivers that support this common protocol. This feature is a solid commitment\nfor the next release, so stay tuned.\n\n\nIf you have other features you'd like to see in EtherCrab, please\nopen a feature request!\nTo current users of EtherCrab, thanks heaps for using it! It's becoming more widely used in some\nreally interesting machines and I love seeing every photo and video posted of EtherCrab in action!\n","id":"https://wapl.es/ethercrab-0-6/","title":"EtherCrab 0.6 Released"},"https://wapl.es/huanyang-linuxcnc-2-7-speed-control/":{"body":"Huanyang branded VFD drives are ubiquitous on eBay and other sites like AliExpress. I bought one\nsome time ago with a 1.5KW spindle and have been controlling the speed manually with the difficult\nto use control panel on the front. It is, however, possible to control the VFD from within LinuxCNC\nusing the M3 and M5 commands\n(I haven't been able to get M4, reverse rotation, working yet). What's also neat is we can get the\nmachine to wait for the spindle to come up to speed before moving to the next line of GCode.\n\nThe first thing I tried was PDM using\nsignals from the parallel port. This doesn't set the speed accurately at all and the PDM/speed\nconversion curve is hilariously inaccurate. If you want to try this method for whatever reason,\nthere's a\nguide in the LinuxCNC documentation.\nMost Huanyang VFDs have an RS-485 two-wire interface, so let's use this to communicate with the\ndrive from LinuxCNC. These inverters supposedly support Modbus but aren't compliant, so a custom HAL\ncomponent for LinuxCNC is required.

The twistedness might help over very long distances as\nRS-485 is differential. For shop use it doesn't really matter.\n\nVFD configuration\nWe first need to change some settings in the VFD. Most of these settings are identical to those\ndefined in the hy_vfd man page so look there\nif you need more information. Running hy_vfd --help from a terminal will give you the same\nhelptext.\nChange the following registers to make the VFD listen on the RS-485 bus for control signals:\nRegisterValue\nPD0012Listen for run commands on the RS-485 bus\nPD0022Listen for frequency/speed commands on the RS-485 bus\nPD1643Baud rate - 38400 baud\nPD1653Communication data method to 8N1 RTU\n\nCheck your VFD manual for other values for these registers.

You can add them yourself by looking at the HAL meter in LinuxCNC for the names.\nNote: Using stepconf again will overwrite some of your custom settings. The INI and other config\nfiles will have to be edited by hand, which is not that hard. You can always use stepconf to test\nthings without saving and then edit the files manually later.\ncustom.hal\n\nIt's worth explaining this line in more detail:\n\n\nAssumes the serial port is located at /dev/ttyUSB0 (because I'm using a USB converter here).

The hy_vfd HAL module doesn't support ASCII modes.\n-r 38400 sets the communication speed to 38400 baud. You need to make sure PD164 is set to 3\nto match this value.\n\nAll options for the hy_vfd command are explained in\nthe user manual.\ncustom_postgui.hal\n\ncustompanel.xml\nWe want/need to display some info about the VFD in the LinuxCNC interface, so we'll write a PyVCP\npanel to do so.\nThis panel is a stripped down version of the default supplied in the original hy-vfd module.

It's a lovely little\nmachine for the price and about 7x faster than my previous dev box. There's one very annoying issue\nthough: the noisy little fan installed on the CPU heatsink. Let's fix that.\n\nI took two approaches here. Skip ahead to the one you prefer:\n\nSwap the fan's 12V power for 5V - requires soldering but is an\nentirely reversible procedure. Very quiet, but runs the CPU a little hot\nInstall a Noctua inline fan speed reducer - still an\nimprovement, but is the noisier of the two solutions. It does however keep the CPU a bit cooler,\nso is probably better for sustained workloads or warmer environments.\n\nRunning the CPU fan off 5V\nThis is my preferred solution for my use case which is compiling code, so quite bursty and not too\nheating.\nThe cooling fan uses PWM to control its speed and runs off 12V through the (thankfully standard!) 4\npin fan connector on the mainboard. I was originally going to swap it out for a 92mm Noctua slim fan\nbut there's just no space for it. Instead, I popped the 12V power pin out of the fan connector and\nsoldered it to a small wire fed through the PCB to steal 5V from the rear USB ports.\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nSlip a bit of heatshrink over the joint and tuck it in behind the connector, making sure to not\nallow any metal to stick out of either end.\n\n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n\nIf you'd like to go back to the stock fan, simply unsolder the added wire from the connector crimp\nterminal and click it back into the original connector. Fan RPM reporting still works accurately\nwith this mod, too.\nWith this method, the fan is practically inaudible even at full pelt, however, the CPU does run\nquite hot.\nMy system is running Linux Mint and with a looped Rust compile to generate some heat load, I saw\n~84C sustained. This is pretty hot, but I'm willing to make the sacrifice for two reasons. One, the\nworkloads I run are quite bursty, and there's enough thermal mass to soak those bursts up without\ntoo much heating. Second, the fan at stock speeds is extremely annoying and the unit sits with me on\nmy desk, so I'd like it to at least be quiet if not silent.\nFor what it's worth, my unit stands on its side with the exhaust vent pointing up, but laying it on\nits feet doesn't make much difference to the peak temperature so either orientation is fine.\nAdding a Noctua fan speed reducer\nThis is the slightly louder, but cooler and no-soldering-required solution for those in a bit of a\npinch or without access to electronics tools. I used a Noctua NA-RC7 but any inline speed reducer\nshould work, thanks to the standard 4 pin fan header in the Morefine.\nWith the same looped Rust compile on Linux, I measured a peak of 73C, a 9C improvement from my\nultra-silent soldering mods above, although I still didn't like the tone of the fan sound with the\ninline reducer.\nClosing out\nI thought I'd share my attempts into quieting down the S500+ as it's a rather nice unit aside from\nthe fan noise.\nThe best solution I think would be a mini adjustable power supply module hooked into the 12V supply\nto the fan to drop it down to maybe 7V or so, allowing one to strike a balance between noise and\ncooling performance for one's different workloads on this machine. The two options presented above\nare just what I had lying around and are the bare minimum, but still effective for the work I'm\ndoing on this box.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/morefine-s500-fan-mod/","title":"Reducing fan noise on the Morefine S500+"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2016/04/26/rust-logentries-docker.html/":{"body":"I'm fascinated by Rust for it's safety and speed, but also because it's simple to write low level\ncode in what feels like a high level language. To that end, I've been working on a small Rust\nproject at TotallyMoney.com (where I work) for the last week or so to\nsee if it's viable for production use. It's a simple service that polls a\nLogentries endpoint for JSON, parses it and saves some values in a\nPostgres database. It's not a very complicated task, but I saw this as a good opportunity to try\nRust in a production-ish role.\n\nHeader photo by Sandra Starke\n\nNote: I could very well have written this in NodeJS like the rest of the app it fits into, but I\nwanted to learn Rust a little better. The memory safety of Rust is somewhat lost on this task but\nit's interesting how the language handles errors and optional types. Read on for more.\n\nI'm not very good at Rust (yet), so I may be writing terrible Rust code. Let me know\n@jam_waffles if I've made any glaring mistakes!\nDependencies\nI'm assuming you've got Rust, Cargo and a project folder (cargo init --bin will do) set up for\nthis project. I'm going to use the following crates:\n\nhyper; HTTP library for making GET requests to Logentries\nchrono; Date and time, we'll be using it to store the log entry timestamp\ntime; More date and time, used in this case for sleeping for a certain number of milliseconds\nrustc_serialize; JSON parsing\n\nMy Cargo.toml looks like this:\n\nCrates will be installed/updated when you run cargo build or cargo run for the first time.\nPretty neat!\nFetching Logentries data\nFirst, we need to fetch some stuff from Logentries to parse. Logentries provides a simple GET\nendpoint which returns lines of a particular log. Their\ndocumentation specifies the URL as something like this:\n\nFor our purposes we only want the last 10 seconds of data (?start=-10000). The code will poll\nLogentries every 5 seconds, so requesting the last 10 seconds worth of data will provide a crude\nmechanism to deal with failures.\nLet's write some Rust. Put this in src/main.rs:\n\nTry running the code with cargo run. With any luck, you should have the last 10 seconds worth of\nLogentries submissions printed in your console. In my case, I see lines like this:\n\nThe rest of the code in this article assumes the data is in this format. It should be reasonably\nsimple to change the code to suit your needs. Once we have the log output, it's just a matter of\nparsing strings however you see fit.\nFiltering and parsing each line\nEach line contains some fields separated by a pipe character, the first of which is a timestamp and\nthe latter of which is some JSON data. We're not interested in any of the other bits. We're also\nonly interested in log lines with { \"status\": \"Success\" }, so we'll do some simple filtering after\nparsing the line.\nOur program now becomes the following:\n\nThis is where Rust's safety starts to shine and look incredibly verbose at the same time. The code\nabove deals with a lot of Result&lt;&gt; and Option&lt;&gt; types, which return Ok() or Err() and\nSome() or None() respectively. Rust checks at compile time to make sure we're matching every\npossible return type, meaning we have to handle the Err() or None() cases in the code above.\nSometimes that means setting a sensible default (0 for elapsed time, for example) or continueing\nif the code can't do anything proper with the current line. This code is going to run as a\npersistent service so it makes sense to continue or otherwise bail on processing the current line\ninstead of, say, panic!ing and quitting the program.\nRunning the program again with cargo run, you should see something like the following:\n\nFurther explanation\nCode comments aren't very good for learning a language by example, so I'll explain some of the code\nabove.\nFirst, we need to fetch some data from Logentries, in this case using the Hyper HTTP library.\n\nHyper's client.get(url).send() reutrns a Result&lt;&gt; which we're matching on. If the request\nfails, it returns Result&lt;Err&gt; which we're handling by panic!()ing as there's no clean way to\nrecover from a failed request (ok so we could just try again using an exponential falloff but let's\nkeep things simple). If we get a Result&lt;Ok&gt;, we return the HTTP response from the match and\nstore it in response for use later.\n+++\nNext, we turn the HTTP response into a BufReader stream. This step isn't necessary but it might\nmake parsing a little faster if the HTTP response can be streamed, although I haven't looked into\nit.\n\n+++\nLet's get a timestamp. Logentries (at least in my case) outputs timestamps formatted in a\nnon-standard way, specifically in the milliseconds part. The last part of the stamp is 4 digits long\n(tens of microseconds or something?) however Rust's %f\ndate format placeholder\nexpects 8 digits, so I'm going to add those on as a string literal along with a fake timezone.\nIf someone can point out a better way of parsing a timestamp like 2016-04-26 15:18:23.1185 using\nDateTime or the chrono crate, please let me know.\n\nNotice the nested match statements in the code above. If everything goes well and we go down the\nSome(created) and Ok(parsed) branches, that parsed date will be assigned to created at the top\nlevel.\nFinally, if there's an error, the code will call continue which skips the remaining iteration of\nthe loop and moves straight on to the next.\nThe rest of the code is similar to the above examples in terms of how match is utilised.\nConclusions and next steps\nRust's strict type system caused me quite a bit of friction coming from a loosely-typed Node\necosystem, but once you get the hang of it the compile time checking and comprehensive, required\nerror handling makes for very safe code. You'll notice above that only one variable is mutable.\nI'm not doing anything fancy with pointers so it doesn't add much for memory safety, but it allows\nthe compiler to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid reassigning variables and such.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/rust/2016/04/26/rust-logentries-docker.html/","title":"Parsing Logentries output safely using Rust"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2016/10/24/rust-christmas-colour-wheel.html/":{"body":"Here's a quick one; I'm making a Christmas display out of a bunch of serially controllable APA106\nRGB LEDs, but how do I turn a value of 0 – 255 into a glorious RGW (Red Green White) struct with\nthe correct colour, and the correct wrapping rules?\nFirst, some theory\nThe code in the next section is based on the RGB linear colour wheel approximation from the\nAdafruit NeoPixel library.\nSo that I can make modifications to the generated colours, it helps to first visualise the RGB\nbrightnesses against time.

This is naturally a bit crap, so I set out to find a Linux-only solution to cross compile for\nmacOS using osxcross. A weekend of pain later, and I\nhave the following post. Hopefully it spares you a weekend of your own pain.\nEnvironment\nThis process should work in any modern-ish Debian-based environment. This is the setup I used:\n\nLinux Mint 19.1, Dell XPS1 15, Intel i9 x64\nRust 1.32.0 (with Rustup)\nClang 6.0.0\n\nI've also tested this process in CircleCI and it seems to be working fine.\nThe only device I have to test on at time of writing is a Macbook Air with macOS Mojave on it. This\nprocess should work for other macOS versions, but is untested.\nRequirements\nThere are a few system dependencies required to work with osxcross. I don't think the version\nrequirements are too strict for the packages listed below. You may want to check the\nosxcross requirements as well if you're\nhaving problems.\n\nBuilding osxcross\nThe following process is based on\nthis tutorial on Reddit\nand some trial and error. I'm using the macOS 10.10 SDK as I had the least problems getting up and\nrunning with it.\nAdd the following to a script called osxcross_setup.sh and make it executable.\n\nNot a lot to it, thanks to the hard work put in by the osxcross developers. Running\n./osxcross_setup.sh should create a folder named osxcross with everything you need in it to\ncross compile to macOS with Clang. This doesn't modify $PATH or install any system files, so is\nuseful for CI as well.\nAppend ./build_gcc.sh to osxcross_setup.sh if you want to use GCC to cross compile.\nConfiguring Cargo\nCargo needs to be told to use the correct linker for the x86_64-apple-darwin target, so add the\nfollowing to your project's .cargo/config file:\n\nIf you've used a different macOS SDK version, you might need to replace darwin14 with darwin15.\nTo check what binary to use, look in osxcross/target/bin.\nBuilding the project\nBecause I chose not to install osxcross at the system level, the $PATH variable must be modified\nfor Cargo to pick up the linker binaries specified previously. The build command changes to:\n\nThis adds [pwd]/osxcross/target/bin to $PATH, which means the linker binaries should get picked\nup. The path must be absolute to work properly, hence $(pwd).\nNow you should have a binary in target/x86_64-apple-darwin/[debug|release] which works on macOS!\nBuilding *-sys crates\nYou can stop here if none of your crates require any C bindings to function. Quite a few of them do,\nso read on if you run into compilation or linking errors.\nThe project I'm cross compiling uses the git2 crate which has\nlibz-sys in its dependency tree. Unfortunately this means\ndigging out a C compiler. The build uses the host system compiler by default, so the architectures\nfor the final binary (target arch) and these linked libraries (host arch) don't match up.\nThe solution to this is to set the CC and CXX environment variables in our build command:\n\nThis uses o64-clang and o64-clang++ in osxcross/target/bin.\nNow git2 compiles, but fails to link! This is due to the fact that libz-sys attempts to link to the\nhost system zlib library. Because I'm building on a Linux machine, this is a Linux-native library\nwhich won't work on macOS.\nLuckily, libz-sys supports building its own statically linked version of zlib. According to\nlibz-sys' build.rs, if\nLIBZ_SYS_STATIC=1 is set in the environment a bundled version of zlib will be built. Because we\nset CC and CXX, this statically linked code will be compiled for a macOS target. The full build\ncommand ends up looking like this:\n\nCI\nI got the above process working in CircleCI, but it should be pretty easy to get any Debian-based CI\nservice to work.\nIt should be possible to cache the osxcross folder so it doesn't have to be built for every job.\nThe cache should be invalidated when your build script(s) change. For example, I use the cache\nchecksum project-v1-{{ \"{{\" }} checksum \"osxcross_setup.sh\" }} to ensure the osxcross folder is\nregenerated correctly.\nWrapping up\nThe final build command is pretty long, so I'd suggest putting it in a script. In my case, I have a\nbuild script containing the following snippet:\n\nNow you can just run ./osxcross_setup.sh and ./build_macos.sh in your CI.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/02/17/rust-cross-compile-linux-to-macos.html/","title":"Cross compiling Rust from Linux to macOS"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/03/04/embedded-graphics-0.4.7-bmp-support.html/":{"body":"Embedded graphics 0.4.7 has been released, along with\na new sister crate, tinybmp! TinyBMP aims to parse BMP-format\nimage data using no dynamic allocations. It targets embedded environments but can be used in any\nplace a small BMP parser is required. Thanks to TinyBMP, Embedded Graphics now supports loading this\nsimple image format. The header photo was made using Embedded Graphics and the\nSSD1331 driver in pure Rust. In this post, I'll talk through how\nthe BMP file is parsed in no_std environments with nom and how to\nget BMP images working with embedded_graphics.\nBMP format\nThe BMP format is pretty simple. It consists of the following sections which I'll cover separately\nbelow:\n\nFile header (metadata)\nDIB header (more metadata)\nColour pallette table (for colour-indexed images, ignored by TinyBMP)\nBitmap information\n\nFile header and DIB header\nI'm not sure why the header is split into two parts, but TinyBMP treats them as a single section as\nthey form a contiguous block of bytes in the file. The parser ignores some extraneous fields in the\nheader. The ones we're interested in are described in the\nHeader struct:\n\nThere are some other fields present in the header segments, but they're not important for bitmap\nparsing.\nTo parse this header, I'm using nom (a parser-combinator library) in\nno_std mode. It's defined in TinyBMP's Cargo.toml like this:\n\nThe parser is pretty simple. BMP data is little-endian encoded, so we can use Nom's le_u16 and\nle_u32 to parse all the fields out with a function called parse_header:\n\nThis takes a slice (&amp;[u8]) and produces a Header struct from the first few bytes of it. It\nshould be pretty self explanatory, but I'll address some odd parts of the code above.\n\ntag!(\"BM\") This is the \"magic bytes\" BM marker for BMP files, and must be present for the BMP\nto be valid.\nLines with a lonesome le_u16 or le_u32 simply skip ahead 2 or 4 bytes respectively. This will\nbe a field in the header that we want to ignore.\n\nThe Header struct is all we need to parse from the BMP file to be able to use it. On 32 bit\nsystems (i.e. ARM MCUs, other embedded devices), Header only\nrequires 28 bytes of RAM.\nNice!\nBitmap information\nBMP pixel data is pretty unremarkable, the only caveat being that the Y values are inverted, with\nthe bottom row at the start of the data. Pixel values are stored in little-endian order in whatever\nbit depth is specified in the header. This will commonly be 32 or 24 bits, but 16, 8 or even 1BPP is\nsupported by the BMP format. Currently, only 8 and 16 BPP images are supported by Embedded\nGraphics. If you'd like to see other bit-depths supported, please\nopen an issue!\nContaining everything\nThe other data type exported by TinyBMP is the\nBmp struct:\n\nThis is how you should use TinyBMP, namely with the\nfrom_slice method:\n\nThis method takes a slice representing a complete BMP file and creates a Bmp from it. The header\nis parsed and a sub-slice of the input data is kept in the image_data field, based on the\nimage_data_start field from the header.\nKeeping with the no_std, low-memory-usage theme,\nBmp only consumes 48 bytes of memory!\nBear in mind the playground uses 64 bit Rust (I think), so memory usage on a 32 bit ARM\nmicrocontroller might even be a bit less. The original bitmap data must be kept somewhere of course,\nbut this works well with include_bytes!() in and embedded context; include_bytes!() data is kept\nin flash memory, leaving precious RAM available for your application. Microcontrollers generally\nhave a lot more flash than RAM, so it's sensible to store large byte arrays in flash.\nEmbedded Graphics\nTinyBMP exposes BMP image data through the\nimage_data() method on\nBmp. We can use this image data to form an Image iterator for Embedded Graphics to use.\nThe struct\nFirst, let's define ImageBmp that wraps a Bmp file with some extra data to allow for cool\nEmbedded Graphics things like transforms:\n\nPixelColor will be used a bit later to make ImageBmp compatible with multiple pixel types.\nYou can read the entire source for ImageBmp\nhere.\nI'll only cover some parts of it to keep this post to a reasonable length.\nIterator setup\nNow we have an ImageBmp, we need to get an iterator for it so the pixel data can be used by\nEmbedded Graphics-compatible libraries. This can be done by creating ImageBmpIterator and\nimplementing IntoIterator for ImageBmp:\n\nimage_data uses the Bmp::image_data() method mentioned above. Note that everything uses\nreferences to the original data, meaning no new allocations of huge amounts of pixel data.\nI'm also adding From&lt;u8&gt; + From&lt;u16&gt; as trait bounds for reasons that will become clear in the\nnext section.\nThe iterator\nThis is the most important part of the compatibility between Embedded Graphics and TinyBMP - the\niterator implementation. It's responsible for iterating over the BMP pixel data correctly (remember\nthat it starts from the bottom up) as well as converting 8 or 16 bit words into the correct\nPixelColor*. This is what it looks like:\n\n(it could probably stand to be optimised a bit. PRs welcome!)\nThis function is responsible for stepping through on screen pixels; a translation may put some of\nthe image off the top left corner of the screen, so those pixels must be skipped. This is why most\nof the function body is wrapped in a loop.\nFor each pixel coordinate, either 1 (for 8BPP) or two (for 16BPP) bytes are taken from the image\ndata and cast to a u16.\nIf the pixel has positive coordinates, it's position and colour are returned. This is where the\nFrom&lt;u8&gt; + From&lt;u16&gt; bounds come in - they allow bit_value.into() to cast the pixel value into\nthe correct PixelColor* used in calling code. I'll explain that better in the next section.\nAn example\nLet's walk through some of the steps to display this image on an embedded display:\n\nThe SSD1331 crate uses the new TinyBMP support in Embedded\nGraphics to draw colour images like the one in the header for this post. The SSD1331 is a 16 bit\ncolour display. It requires pixel data to be sent to it as 16 bit words split into 5 red, 6 green\nand 5 blue colour bits. This works nicely as we can use\nPixelColorU16\nto iterate over an image correctly.\nFirst, we need an RGB565 image. The GIMP can export these quite easily - go to File -&gt; Export As or\npress Shift + Ctrl + E and save as a file ending in .bmp. The BMP\nexport options dialog will now show up. Make sure you choose Advanced Options -&gt; 16 bits -&gt;\nR5 G6 B5 option when exporting:\n\nNow we have a 16 bit BMP, it can be loaded into a Rust program using include_bytes!(), like this:\n\nim can now be used to draw to a display compatible with Embedded Graphics with a simple\ndisp.draw(im.into_iter()) command. There's a complete example\nhere in the SSD1331 examples folder\nif you want to see a complete program.\nBecause Rust is awesome, it should be able to figure out whether you intended to use PixelColourU8\nor PixelColorU16 based on the type of pixel the display driver uses. 8BPP BMP images will be\nconverted to either type, and 16BPP BMP images will automatically convert two-byte words into a\nPixelColorU16 which should make more images compatible with more displays.\nAnd that's it! BMP support is great for Embedded Graphics, as it's now far simpler to work with\nimages that are used in embedded projects. Hell, it's even just nice to get an image preview in the\nfile browser! More image formats will be added in the future, namely ones that support simple\ncompression like TGA et al, so stay tuned.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/03/04/embedded-graphics-0.4.7-bmp-support.html/","title":"Embedded Graphics 0.4.7 and TinyBMP 0.1.0"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/06/03/diesel-and-tower-web.html/":{"body":"We're building a new product at work, for which we've decided to use Rust\nand tower-web for the backend.

This\ntime, we'll be looking at some not-so-great optimisations made to a point sorting function.\nUpdate: A kind Twitter user pointed out a more optimised solution for triangles which you can find\nhere.\nSome context\nI've already covered\ninteger-only line intersections, a building\nblock for computing the corners of both mitered and bevelled line joints. Between then and now, I've\nwritten some test code to triangulate between these computed corners and form a set of thick lines.\nBelow is an example of a triangle. You can see (if you squint hard enough) the wireframe component\ntriangles on the left, and the final filled triangle on the right. Looks alright!\n\n\nNow the issue is stroke offsets. Embedded-graphics allows three stroke positions relative to the\ntheoretical \"skeleton\" lines of a shape: centered, inside and outside. To ensure the offset remains\non the same side of each edge of the triangle (or polygon), we need to ensure that all points in the\nshape are sorted in clockwise order. This allows us to derive the outside lines highlighted in\nmagenta in the image below:\n\nIf the points aren't sorted correctly, some lines will flip sides over their length.\nThe approach\nI'll focus on triangles for this article, but the approach described here should work for any number\nof points.\nBecause embedded-graphics aims to be as fast as possible, it tries to avoid floating point maths\nwhen possible. Conventional triangle sorting algorithms use the dot product of two vectors to\ndetermine order, which typically requires a tan() call (I think? What do I look like, a\nmathsologist?) so we'll have to find a different solution.\nLuckily, there's an integer-only method as described in\nthis Stackoverflow answer to sort two points by angle.\nWe can use this sorting function as a predicate to the builtin sort_unstable_by method in Rust,\nbut we need to make a few changes first.\nThis is the original C(++?) from https://stackoverflow.com/a/6989383/383609:\n\nThis needs porting to performant Rust, so let's crack on.\nMore junk\nFirst, though, we need some supporting code.\nLet's say we define a Triangle with three Points like this:\n\nWhere Point is:\n\nWe need a way to create triangles, and a way to get a triangle with all of its points sorted in\nclockwise order. Thus:\n\nNotice the sort_clockwise function buried in there? That's what we'll focus on.\n\nNote: I'm getting the triangle's bounding box and using its center instead of finding the true\ntriangle \"center of gravity\" here - it's fast, and good enough for the purposes I need this method\nfor.\n\nStraight port from C/C++ to Rust\nThis is a syntax port of the original code to Rust. Pretty straightforward.\n\nThere's not much to mention here other than the fact we're still returning a bool. This needs to\nbe wrapped in a match to be usable by sort_unstable_by in Triangle::sorted_clockwise:\n\nChanging to use Ordering\nThe above code doesn't feel very Rust-like, but we'll try and fix that better in a bit. For now\nthough, one good cleanup to make is to stop returning a bool and return an Ordering directly:\n\nThat's better! In terms of style, I'm happy with where this is at so I won't change it any futher.\nPerformance-wise, though, surely we can tune it some more?\nPerformance tuning\nFirst, one of the simplest optimisations is present in the original code: don't do work you don't\nhave to! For example, the det variable is only computed if the function falls through to where\nit's needed.\nNext are some attempts I made at optimising this code a bit better.\nHoist some comparisons\nRecomputing the same thing a few times seems pointless, so I'll hoist the two negations into the\nvariables d_ax and d_bx for reuse.\n\nUse .cmp and Ordering tricks\nWe've hoisted some calculations, but we can also hoist some of the comparisons into cmp_ax and\ncmp_bx. This also lets us squash everything into one giant match block. I'm not sure if it's\neasier to read, but it sure is some juicy Pro Rust™.\n\nBenchmarking\nAll benchmarks are run on x64 Linux Mint 20, Ryzen 7 3700X overclocked to 3.8 GHz, 32GB DDR4 3200.\nI'm using the venerable criterion crate to run the benchmarks\nand avoid some of the pitfalls when micro-benchmarking.\nSuiteResult (avg)\nStraight C port (baseline)9.4473 ns\nUse Ordering instead of bool10.712 ns\nHoist some repeated comparisons10.160 ns\nConvert everything to a big, single match12.024 ns\n\nCuriously, on x64 at least, all of the nice changes resulted in regressions! Thankfully they're\npretty minor, but it was surprising to see that nothing changed for the better. There's a lot of\nrhetoric in Rust optimisation articles about idiomatic code allowing for better optimisations, but\nit doesn't seem to apply in this case.\nI don't show it here because it'd make the article too long, but I benchmarked a few other triangles\nwith different properties, and all are sorted at pretty much the same speed.\nIf you're interested, here's the bench code:\n\nPolygons\nWhat's the performance like for shapes with more than three points (i.e. polygons)? That's easy\nenough to test with a benchmark with more points in it:\n\nA triangle sorts in about about 4ns per point, however the sort doesn't scale linearly. The above\nbenchmark with 14 points sorts in about 140ns, or roughly 10ns per point. This will be overhead in\nthe sorting algorithm, as the sort function itself has a fixed input size.\nFinal result\nNow triangle points are correctly ordered!\n\n\nNotice the order of P1, P2 and P3 changes to keep the outside edge on the left of each line.\nThe only point that is moved between the two screenshots is P2 in the first (becoming P3).\nConclusion\nSo, which version is best? Considering they all have about the same performance, I went with\nsort_clockwise_use_ordering. I think it offers a good balance between readability and performance\n(by being basically the same as the naive bool C port). If the other methods improved performance\na large amount, I might've gone with the Pro Rust™ nested match with guards, but it's certainly\nnot easily read.\n\nPerformance stuff is always worth checking if you're not sure! It's also pretty simple with\ncriterion doing most of the heavy lifting.\nThat said, always take microbenchmarks with a grain of salt. In this case, that is even more\nrelevant as architecture differences between the target ARMv7 CPUs embedded-graphics is designed for\nand the beefy x64 the benchmarks are running on may have vastly different performance profiles.\nIdeally, benchmark on your target hardware if you can.\nThe final benchmark iteration time is about 10ns on my desktop. This post only discusses part of the\nfinal algorithm, so it does add up, but for now there are bigger fish to fry...\nAnother thing to do would be to look at the generated assembly. This might be important for\noptimising on ARM targets without being able to run benches on the target hardware, but I'll uhh\nleave that as an exercise for the reader because I can barely read assembly as it is, let alone grok\nthe performance of individual instructions.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading!

You should probably create type aliases like\ntype Uuid = string;. It might not aid with format checking, but it will at least make clear to\nother programmers what the intent of that field is.\nA better idea might be to use io-ts which would let you do\nawesome things like validate your payloads at runtime using the type system!\nAnyway, now that those types are defined, events can be created that match the correct type\nsignature:\n\nThis isn't too bad. Fields in data can't be missed and, critically, the event metadata (type,\nevent_namespace and event_type) fields can't be typoed! Thanks Typescript!\nFirst attempt: lazy is dangerous\nThe above is alright I guess. At least the final event object is checked at compile time before\nserializing and sending/storing it. The problem is it's pretty verbose. Wouldn't it be nicer to have\na function that, given a data payload just makes us an event? This is what I came up with to\nsolve this problem the first time:\n\nNeat. Now the programmer doesn't have to care about the particular shape of the object, just some\nspecific fields. Usage looks like this:\n\nThis is obviously a lot cleaner. The programmer doesn't have to worry about the joined type field\nmatching event_namespace and event_type anymore, and the UUID and timestamp are automatically\ninserted in the right places. The event's shape will also always be correct. But there's a\nproblem...\nTypescript doesn't type check this properly! At least it didn't at the time of writing. For example,\nadding an explicit type still doesn't catch the incorrect spelling of some_namespace in the\nexample below:\n\nThis is more ergonomic, but is a step backward in the reliability of the system. Mistyped fields\nand events with missing keys were encountered in production when using the createEvent defined\nabove. This is pretty terrible. We should be pushing the programmer into the\npit of success!\nInto the pit - safely\nWhat createEvent needs is some actual, smart type checking. Issues arose when we decided to make\ncreateEvent construct the returned object from a few different fields in its arguments.\nTypechecking multiple arguments that get munged into a single object is pretty difficult (at least\nin Typescript) but can be done as you'll see next:\n\nUsage looks like this:\n\nNearly identical to before, save for adding &lt;BlogEvent&gt; to the call signature. Our ergonomics are\npreserved, but now we get proper type checking! Any errors in any arguments will fail to compile.\nFor example:\n\nThis code couples the power of generics with Typescripts weird (but quite pleasant)\nstring-literals-are-types feature to enforce that, given an event payload, the string arguments\ngiven to createEvent must match whatever is defined for BlogEvent. The magic comes from using\nthe indexed access operator\n(you'll have to search through that page to find it) T[\"field_here\"] syntax to match the string\nliterals, and some gymnastics to implement an Omit type. This type states, in plainer words, every\nfield in D except type, event_namespace and event_type must be present in the passed\nobject. This is good for the programmer - if they pass in those fields in the data object, they get\noverwritten anyway, leading to unexpected behaviour. By denying them in the body, we enforce a more\ncorrect, safer way of creating events.\nThe code isn't as elegant as just providing a type, but now it means that our function properly\ntype checks the resulting object. This means no more typoed event name fields and no more\nmissing/mis-spelled data fields! This inelegance can also be tucked away in some library code,\nleaving just the nice interface. The only caveat with the above implementation that I've found so\nfar is that the programmer must explicitly provide the type, or typechecking won't be \"enabled\".\nThere's a compiler option - --noImplicitAny - which might help with this but I haven't tried it\nyet.\nTypescript is actually good if you don't slap anys everywhere and leverage its type system\nfully. People have a lot of strong opinions both ways about static type checking, but if it stops\nbroken stuff getting into production, then it absolutely should be another tool in your toolbox.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/typescript/2018/12/10/typechecking-helper-functions-in-typescript.html/","title":"Typechecking builder functions in Typescript"},"https://wapl.es/typescript/2019/03/14/xml-jsx-sitemaps-in-typescript.html/":{"body":"I maintain the Repositive website which uses React for the frontend and a\nserver that supports server side rendering for the speed and SEO benefits of SSR.

Like lots of companies, understanding what users do\nand how they interact with a product is to get good insight on. In this regard, people reinvent the\nlogging wheel with various krimskrams attached, me\nbeing no exception. What I want to show in this post is how to integrate an event logging framework\ninto a React/Redux application in a way that's scaleable and testable. Unit testable logging is\nimportant when the rest of the business relies heavily on the events and the data in them like many\ncompanies do.\n\ntl;dr: pass your logger to React's context to make logging from deeply nested components much\neasier.\nIn this article, I'm assuming you've got an existing React/Redux application, and want to integrate\nsome kind of event logging library into it.\nThe logging library\nLet's make a fake logging library that looks like this:\n\nThis could be anything, even something like Google Analytics or Firebase. How you log events and to\nwhere doesn't really matter as the logging code will be contained inside an action creator.\nRedux – Action creator\nAction creators in Redux can have side effects like making API calls or, in our case, logging\nsomething. We'll create a simple action creator like this:\n\n❶ Define a default empty object, so we don't have to worry about handling undefined or null values.\n❷ Returning something from this action creator isn't strictly necessary for just logging events\nusing the logger, but if you want to record those events in your Redux store, you need to return an\naction for the reducers to respond to.\nWe now have an action creator that, when called, will log an event over our pretend websocket-based\nlogging library. Let's hook it up to a button in React.\nIntegration with React (the bad way)\nThe simplest and perhaps obvious way is to pass down an event handler to the elment you want to log\nan event from. React encourages this pattern for handling other events, so why not logs? When an\nevent is fired, your code would handle that in the top level Redux-connected page component. We\ncould pepper Redux' connect() through our component tree, but that makes testing harder, which\nis the opposite of what we want to do. It also tightly couples our app to Redux instead of dealing\nwith plain old Javascript objects.\nThis following example is for a login page where we want to log an event when the submit button is\nclicked. Here, logging that event isn't too bad because we already have a click handler for the\nsubmit button. But what if we had a different component with no other props? In this case, we'd have\nto write a handleClick function in the top level component, and pass an onClick prop all the way\nthrough the component tree. This is noisy, boilerplate-y and error prone. In the next section, I'll\nshow a better way of doing this.\n\nIntegration with React (the good better way)\nA better way to handle this logging is to use React's\ncontext functionality. Context\nshould be used sparingly\nand its caveats like coupling global state, but in this case it can help us create a far cleaner\nlogging implementation. First, we need to make a context provider that will make the logger\navailable to all child components in our app:\n\nHere we:\n❶ Define childContextTypes to allow child components to ask for logEvent using their\ncontextTypes property.\n❷ Make the definition of logEvent. In this case, it's a function that will be called like\ncontext.logEvent('foo', { bar: 'true '}) which matches the Redux action signature written earlier.\n❸ Don't need any state from the store, so we can just return an empty object.\nThis component won't work without a Redux store. We can add that by wrapping it in a Provider\ncomponent from react-redux. An example application might\nlook like this:\n\nMake sure LoggerProvider is a child of Provider. If it's the other way round, you won't be able\nto access the store. Now let's modify the &lt;SubmitButton /&gt; component we want to log events from to\ngive it access to context:\n\n❶ Stateless functional components access context through the second argument of the function\ndeclaration.\n❷ React requires you to explicitly mark which pieces of the context you want using\nComponent.contextTypes. In this case, just logEvent which is a function. If you don't add this,\nlogEvent will be undefined!\nAssuming your app uses LoggerProvider somewhere near the top of its component tree, you should now\nbe able to call context.logEvent which will dispatch a Redux action with the functionality\nprovided by LoggerProvider. This should work wherever this component is in the component tree.\nTesting with Mocha and Enzyme\nEasy testability is a very useful side-effect of using the context method. You could add spies and\nassertions around a Redux store, but this then requires you to store logged events in your store\nwhich you might not want to do (e.g. with third party logging libraries). It also leads to a much\nmore complex test harness involving Redux and a &lt;Provider&gt;.\nI'm using Mocha, Enzyme,\nChai and Sinon for this article, but this technique\nshould be applicable to most test environments.\nUsing context in a component comes with the caveat that a context obejct must be present in Enzyme\nunit tests. This can get a little frustrating and introduces some obtuse errors if one is not aware\nof the context requirement. However I think the benefits outweigh these extra steps. Context\ncan easily be passed into components,\nmaking it extremely simple to pass spies and catch logging calls.\nIt's not strictly necessary, but I'm going to use\nsinon-chai to make error messages a bit clearer.\nHere's our test:\n\nWe've got two tests here:\n\n\nCalls the onClick event when clicked. Checks to make sure onSubmit() is called when the\nbutton is clicked. This isn't relevant to event log testing, it just shows another Enzyme test\nbeing used.\n\n\nLogs an event when clicked. Checks that logEvent was called, and with the correct arguments.\n.calledWith('loginSubmit', { foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux' }) should be replaced with whatever shape\nof event you're logging. In this example, it's hardcoded to\n('loginSubmit', { foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux' }).\n\n\nIf you've set everything up right, you should see something like this:\n\nHooray!\nConclusion\nReact's context can be pretty powerful when used sparingly. Here, I've presented an approach to\nevent collection that makes logging from deeply nested React nodes easier, simpler and more\ntestable. However, I think it's important to take multiple approaches to event logging depending on\nwhere the event needs to be fired from. If you can do it without using context, do that! You lose\nsome ability to test using a spy in your tests, but it makes component testing simpler with less\nconfiguration by not requiring a fake context. If you can log an event inside another action\ncreator, that's the best way to go if possible. If not, using a context provider leads to a more\nscalable approach for larger apps with deeply nested component trees.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/web/2017/09/21/analytics-events-with-redux-and-react.html/","title":"Logging analytics events in a testable way with React and Redux"},"https://wapl.es/workshop/2016/11/12/scraping-without-a-scraper.html/":{"body":"In between watching the rain and emptying all the shmoo out of my air compressor (long overdue), I\ndecided to try my hand at some impromptu scraping this weekend. Matters were complicated somewhat\ndue to me not owning a scraping tool, but I worked with what I have to make what I think are some\nsatisfctory results. This post will be a short log of what went down and will hopefully demonstrate\nthat one can achieve reasonably good (i.e. flat) results without having a real scraper.\n\nI bought a shitty magbase indicator holder off eBay a while back (header image). It's served me well\nenough, but the major pain point is the base - it's not even close to being flat. This makes the\nindicator wobble if you knock it, and reduces magnetic stiction significantly due to the magnetic\nfield having to pass through air which sucks at transmitting magnetic flux. After the\nscraping/flattening process described below, the magbase holds a lot better and without any\nperceptible wobble and is finally a usable, useful bit of shop equipment.\nI've been watching\nStefan Gotteswinter's series on improving an import angle plate\nwhich was a great help in learning the general techniques of scraping a surface in. Stefan uses an\nelectric scraper and a posh granite surface plate whereas I have a cast iron surface plate, a file\nand a lathe toolbit. YMMV but if you're on a budget, I think you can get pretty good results without\neye wateringly expensive equipment.\n\nScraping started with a small triangular file. This will make most sensible machinists cringe, but\nit works quite well and removes material more quickly than a scraping tool which sped up the initial\nflattening significantly. After that, I moved on to using a lathe toolbit that had been ground into\nsome kind of external grooving tool before I got my hands on it. I freshened the edge up and went to\ntown with that in leu of a proper scraping tool. In hindsight, I should've ground the edge into a\ncrescent instead of leaving it flat but hey, it's all part of the learning experience.\nAfter a bunch of print/scrape/deburr/print cycles, I ended up with a pretty consistent contact\npattern. The surface is still full of file marks despite my best efforts to sand them down, but the\nmost important thing is that it's a uniform surface. See what you think:\n\nSo it turns out that scraping is one of those pleasantly satisfying manual processes, and it gave me\nan excuse to break out the seldom used surface plate. I'd definitely like to get better at scraping\nand get the right tools to do it with in the future, my only problem now is finding something worth\nscraping in.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/workshop/2016/11/12/scraping-without-a-scraper.html/","title":"Scraping without a scraper"}},"docInfo":{"https://wapl.es/":{"body":0,"title":2},"https://wapl.es/a-collection-of-rust-optimisation-results/":{"body":487,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/airsoft/2016/03/07/gng-p90-mag-fix.html/":{"body":221,"title":6},"https://wapl.es/announcing-ethercrab-the-rust-ethercat-controller/":{"body":1338,"title":6},"https://wapl.es/cnc/2016/02/04/cnc-steppers-bipolar-parallel-faster-smoother.html/":{"body":82,"title":10},"https://wapl.es/cnc/2020/01/25/linuxcnc-simulator-build-linux-mint.html/":{"body":91,"title":7},"https://wapl.es/cnc/2020/02/23/linuxcnc-jog-wheel-setup.html/":{"body":500,"title":6},"https://wapl.es/cnc/rust/2020/01/27/writing-a-linuxcnc-driver.html/":{"body":754,"title":8},"https://wapl.es/cv/":{"body":0,"title":3},"https://wapl.es/electriq-iqool-aircon-esphome-home-assistant/":{"body":868,"title":7},"https://wapl.es/electronics/rust/2018/04/30/ssd1306-driver.html/":{"body":327,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/electronics/rust/2019/02/13/sh1106-driver.html/":{"body":243,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/elm/2017/12/12/elm-counting-occurrences.html/":{"body":539,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/esp32-tlc5940-rmt/":{"body":653,"title":7},"https://wapl.es/ethercat-sii-eeprom-checksum/":{"body":107,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/ethercrab-0-4-io-uring-derives-ethercat-distributed-clocks/":{"body":1182,"title":7},"https://wapl.es/ethercrab-0-5/":{"body":164,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/ethercrab-0-6/":{"body":641,"title":3},"https://wapl.es/huanyang-linuxcnc-2-7-speed-control/":{"body":680,"title":8},"https://wapl.es/linux/2018/09/03/linux-mint-19-office-365.html/":{"body":86,"title":8},"https://wapl.es/linuxcnc-simulator-linux-mint-21-3/":{"body":89,"title":7},"https://wapl.es/morefine-s500-fan-mod/":{"body":367,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/rust/2016/04/26/rust-logentries-docker.html/":{"body":597,"title":6},"https://wapl.es/rust/2016/10/24/rust-christmas-colour-wheel.html/":{"body":190,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/rust/2017/10/06/git2-rs-cloning-private-github-repos.html/":{"body":96,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/rust/2018/02/19/cross-platform-gdb-safe-path.html/":{"body":104,"title":6},"https://wapl.es/rust/2018/12/13/optimising-new.html/":{"body":63,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/02/17/rust-cross-compile-linux-to-macos.html/":{"body":440,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/03/04/embedded-graphics-0.4.7-bmp-support.html/":{"body":777,"title":5},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/06/03/diesel-and-tower-web.html/":{"body":123,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/06/16/embedded-graphics-0-5-0.html/":{"body":305,"title":3},"https://wapl.es/rust/2020/07/25/optimising-with-cmp-and-ordering.html/":{"body":745,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/rust/2020/07/26/perf-addendum.html/":{"body":156,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/rust/2021/07/24/dont-forget-to-change-pin-mode.html/":{"body":143,"title":8},"https://wapl.es/rust/2022/07/03/const-builder-pattern.html/":{"body":302,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/rust/embedded-graphics/2020/07/09/integer-graphics-line-intersection.html/":{"body":115,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/typescript/2018/12/10/default-arguments-for-cooler-testing.html/":{"body":304,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/typescript/2018/12/10/typechecking-helper-functions-in-typescript.html/":{"body":549,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/typescript/2019/03/14/xml-jsx-sitemaps-in-typescript.html/":{"body":112,"title":4},"https://wapl.es/web/2017/09/21/analytics-events-with-redux-and-react.html/":{"body":672,"title":7},"https://wapl.es/workshop/2016/11/12/scraping-without-a-scraper.html/":{"body":260,"title":3}},"length":41},"lang":"English"};
