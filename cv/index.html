      <h2>Edinburgh, Scotland</h2>

    <div class="cv__description">
      <p>
        Hi, I'm James, a Rust, electronics and CNC enthusiast. My work revolves around the wonderful
        Rust programming language, gladly using it both professionally, personally and in open
        source to write high quality code for web, Linux (embedded and desktop), microcontrollers
        and realtime systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I've been programming for about 20 years since I was 10, beginning with 8 bit assembler,
        Visual Basic and C. I started my professional career at 18 with PHP web development, then
        moved towards the JavaScript/Typescript ecosystem for a while. I discovered Rust about 5
        years ago and am now working in it fulltime.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm motivated by engaging software problems, challenging optimisations, interesting
        performance debugging and making a polished product for people to use. I strongly believe we
        work best in a team, each of us adding to something greater than the sum of parts.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also have a good interest in electronics. It was a quick discovery after computers and has
        become a long running hobby, most recently developing a Rust EtherCAT controller for
        microcontrollers.
      </p>

      <p>
        Melding electronics and programming lead me to discover the expensive yet fascinating world
        of DIY CNC machines, myself having built at least 5 of improving capabilities (and heft)
        over time, with a parallel dream of building motion control software one day. Stepping into
        the garage to work on/with the machine with one's hands is a great escape from the keyboard.
      </p>

          - EtherCrab is a pure-Rust EtherCAT master runtime born of the frustrations of working
          with existing C-based libraries. It is fully <code>async</code> and has a threadsafe
          design, which was a fun challenge to implement correctly, encapsulating unsafe code and
          providing a foolproof API.

            Worked with another developer to architect and implement the company's new cloud
            application from scratch using a Rust backend and Typescript/React frontend. Jira was
            used to gather and track requirements and progress.
          </li>

          <li>
            Ensured the application was compliance‐ready using an event sourcing paradigm to record
            the atomic history of actions against entities in the application. What PII and where it
            was stored was also taken into consideration to comply with GDPR regulations.
          </li>

          <li>
            Released the event sourcing machinery as an open source library for reuse in other

          <li>
            Maintained and developed a Typescript library to make using the event‐sourcing paradigm

            Evangelised Rust within the company, producing some data‐processing tools to work

            where possible.

          <li>
            Scratch‐built a brand new platform after a pivot, using Rust with PostgreSQL as the
