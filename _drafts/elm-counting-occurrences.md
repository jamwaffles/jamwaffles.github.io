So. Elm. It's been an interesting experience for me, coming from a procedural language background. The learning curve is steep, but the functional nature of Elm, along with its compile time type safety really pays off, especially for data handling. The only problem I've found as a newcomer however, is that the documentation can be really frustrating sometimes. In this post, I hope to remedy that slightly by providing a newcomer's perspective on a little bit of data processing in Elm.
