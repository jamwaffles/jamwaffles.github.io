None of this pertains to real firearms.\nI have a G&amp;G P90 (in tan, in case you were wondering) and like many others suffer from the hicap\nmags failing to feed. Half filling them kind of works, but the feed mechanism always seems to jam.\nI've got a half solution here in this article. It doesn't completely fix the problem, but my hicaps\nfeed a lot more reliably now, particularly in semi-auto, than they did before.\nThis fix works by supergluing a couple of BBs into strategic places in the mag to agitate the BBs\nand make them fall into the feed mechanism more reliably.\nFirst, crack open your mag by unscrewing every sccrew you can find. The mag has an outer shell and\nan inner box, both of which you'll need to open. None of the internals should spring out, take care\nduring this step.\nStopping 'back jamming'\nI had problems where BBs would roll back into the feed wheel and cause it to jam. I fixed this by\nsupergluing a BB into a spot in the mag like this:\n\nThe feed roller on the left rotates clockwise and must make sure the BB clears the spokes on the\nwell so it can turn freely. About half a BB's width between the spokes and your glued BB is what you\nshould aim for.\nAgitating BBs\nThis is perhaps the more effective mod, and it should ensure BBs are fed into the spoked feed wheel\nbetter as they usually have a tendency to clump up from the spring pressure of the mag. I solved\nthis using half a BB glued to the pre-feed wheel.\nI cut a BB in half with some sidecutters and filed it smooth on the bottom so glue would bond\nbetter:\n\nI then glued it near the center of the pre-feed wheel (gear on the right) like this:\n\nScrew the mag back together (don't forget the filler hatch) and you should be good to go. It's quite\ndifficult to break a mag using this method as the BBs can be snapped or sanded out if necessary,\njust don't glue any of the gears or wheels!\nAs with all stuff like this, your mileage may vary. This mod has worked out ok for me although I do\nstill get some jams which are cleared by shaking the mag back and forth or giving it a good whack on\nthe top. I take excellent care of my airsoft gear...\n","id":"https://wapl.es/airsoft/2016/03/07/gng-p90-mag-fix.html/","title":"G&G P90 hicap mag feeding fix(ish)"},"https://wapl.es/cnc/2016/02/04/cnc-steppers-bipolar-parallel-faster-smoother.html/":{"body":"Quick tip: if you're looking for higher maximum speeds with your bipolar stepper motors, try wiring\nthe windings in parallel instead of series.

A quick\nsearch for\nCNC jog pendant\non AliExpress turns up a bunch of results. For this post, I'll cover connecting a wired jog pendant\nwith ESTOP to a Mesa 5i25 FPGA card to control a 3 axis CNC mill.\nThe config below works for me. The plethora of hardware configs out there mean this article likely\nwon't work for you verbatim, but it's my hope that it provides a good starting point for other\nconfigs.\nPlease note that I got this config working on LinuxCNC 2.9.0-pre0. It should also work on 2.8.*,\nbut will not work on anything before the joints/axes split.\nHardware\n\n    \n\nThis is the jog pendant I'll be using.\nIt provides estop, axis select, multiplier and encoder outputs on a bunch of bare wires as seen in\nthe image. I'm going to connect it to the internal P2 connector of a Mesa 5i25 FPGA card, so I'll\ntrim the bare wires and solder them to a DB25 cable-end connector in a bit.\n\n\n    \n\nI'm using a Mesa 5i25 FPGA card through a DB25 breakout cable (like\nthis one) connected to P2. Other Mesa cards with\nparallel port breakout options like the 6i25 should also work, but are untested.\nThe Mesa card can optionally provide +5V to external circuitry on the last 4 pins of the parallel\nport connector. This must be enabled for the jog pendant to work. From the manual, ensure that\njumper W1 is in the UP position.\nFor reference, here's an image of the breakout cable:\n\n\nSoldering up the jog wheel connector\nWe now need to solder a DB25 connnector to the jog pendant cable so it can be plugged into the Mesa\ncard. The exact pinout doesn't matter too much as connections can be remapped in software, but in\nmy setup the jog wheel encoder is bound to pins 11 and 12.\nThis is the full pinout:\nNameDB25 connector pinHostmot2 GPIO (we'll use this later)Wire colour\nESTOP4gpio.023Blue/black\nESTOP gnd21-Blue\nEncoder +5V25-Red\nEncoder gnd20-Black\nEncoder A11encoder.01.input-aGreen\nEncoder B12encoder.01.input-bWhite\nEncoder A---Purple\nEncoder B---Purple/black\nCommon19-Orange/black\nSelect axis X1gpio.017Yellow\nSelect axis Y14gpio.018Yellow/black\nSelect axis Z2gpio.019Brown\nSelect axis 45-Brown/black\nX115gpio.020Grey\nX103gpio.021Grey/black\nX10016gpio.022Orange\nLED+--Green/black\nLED---White/black\n\nEncoder +5V, Encoder gnd and Common are connected to ground and +5V, with the 5V supplied by\nthe last 4 pins by enabling the auxiliary power on the Mesa card by setting jumper W1 to the UP\nposition.\nI'm leaving the inverted signals of the encoder disconnected for simplicity. If you need the noise\nsuppression features of differential wiring, you'll need to add some external circuitry to deal with\nthat - the Mesa encoder inputs are single-sided.\nI'm also leaving the enable LED disconnected because I can't be bothered to hook it up.\nMesa card configuration\nI'm using the 5i25_prob_rfx2 bitfile for the Mesa 5i25. It seems to be a pretty general purpose\nconfig for these cards. Other configs might work, but the pinout could be different so YMMV.\nThe pendant is mostly simple GPIO, but you'll need to add an extra encoder to your Mesa config when\nloaded. In your &lt;machine name&gt;.hal file, find the loadrt line and change it:\n- loadrt hm2_pci config=\"firmware=hm2/5i25/5i25_prob_rfx2 num_encoders=1 num_pwmgens=0 num_stepgens=3\"\n+ loadrt hm2_pci config=\"firmware=hm2/5i25/5i25_prob_rfx2 num_encoders=2 num_pwmgens=0 num_stepgens=3\"\n\nThis will add an extra encoder called encoder.01 for the HAL config to use later.\nThe above hm2 config is for a 3 axis mill with a spingle encoder. Because I'm already using one\nencoder for the spindle, I'm upping the encoder count to 2. This puts the second encoder signals\non pins 11 and 12 of the DB25 connector on P2 which we'll use for the jog pendant. If you've got a\ndifferent number of encoders, you might have to change the connector pinout in the table above or\nuse a completely different Mesa card/tutorial. Sorry.\nJog pendant HAL configuration\nCreate a new HAL file called mpg.hal and add the following:\n# MPG (jog wheel) config\n#\n# MPG is plugged into secondary (internal) connector via a DB25 breakout cable.

The 5i25 has weak pullups, so pins are active low and\ndefault to high (TRUE).\nI'm using mux16 instead of mux4 because I'm lazy.\nBecause the jog wheel is a quadrature encoder, there are 4 counts per \"click\". The jog scales of\n0.00025, 0.0025, etc are the 1x, 10x and 100x markings on the pendant panel divided\nby 4.\nThe selected-jog-incr, joint-select-* and joint-selected-count signals are wired to both\nthe joint and axis signals. This is required to make the axes move after homing, and is a\nresult of the joints/axes split that happened around LinuxCNC 2.8/2.9.\n\nFinally, to load this extra HAL config into the machine, add a line to the [HAL] section in\n&lt;config name&gt;.ini:\n  [HAL]\n  HALUI = halui\n  HALFILE = &lt;config name&gt;.hal\n+ HALFILE = mpg.hal\n  POSTGUI_HALFILE = postgui_call_list.hal\n  SHUTDOWN = shutdown.hal\n\nNow you should be good.

You\ncan find them at linuxcnc-hal (high-level interface) and\nlinuxcnc-hal-sys (low-level interface). The rest of\nthis post is a getting started tutorial, so follow along if you have a cool idea for a custom bit of\nCNC hardware and an itch to write the interface in Rust!\nLinuxCNC is a popular, open source machine controller. It's very powerful\nand is an excellent way to get into CNC on an absolute budget. LinuxCNC is also expandable with\ncustom components called HAL components or HAL comps.\nUp to now, most components are written in C or Python. Pretty unsafe or slow - these languages don't\nmake the best choice for a potentially heavy/dangerous/fast machine! With its safety and low to zero\noverhead, Rust is a prime replacement for writing HAL comps, however there doesn't seem to be any\nway to integrate Rust with LinuxCNC... until now!\nThere are\nexamples for\nboth, but\nlet's go through making a HAL component step by step!\nA primer on HAL components\nLinuxCNC has the concept of a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer). The HAL allows (among other things)\ncustom components to be loaded at startup which hook into the HAL using virtual \"pin\"s. These pins\nallow comps to take inputs from LinuxCNC and provide outputs to it. A HAL component is often used to\ncommunicate with custom hardware such as VFDs, toolchangers or information readouts.\nA HAL component is a normal binary with a standard main() function, however there are certain\ncomponent-specific actions that must be taken to hook it into LinuxCNC. The two crates mentioned\nabove (linuxcnc-hal and\nlinuxcnc-hal-sys) facilitate this linking in Rust.\nHello world\nLet's write a basic component with one input and one output pin to get a feel for the interface. Set\nup a binary project and add linuxcnc-hal as a dependency:\ncargo new --bin hello-comp\ncd hello-comp\ncargo add linuxcnc-hal\n\n\nYou might need to install cargo-edit if cargo add\nisn't found:\ncargo install --force cargo-edit\n\nThe code described below should go into src/main.rs.\nFirst, we need some imports. Both the input and output are going to accept f32 values, so we'll\nuse HalPinF64. Other types\nare available.\nuse linuxcnc_hal::{hal_pin::HalPinF64, HalComponentBuilder};\nuse std::{\n    error::Error,\n    thread,\n    time::{Duration, Instant},\n};\n\nMoving onto main(), we need to change the signature slightly as the component is going to return a\nResult for better error handling. Replace any existing main() with this:\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n    // Everything will go here\n}\n\nNow let's populate main(). First, a HalComponentBuilder needs to be created. This is the first\nthing that should happen as it registers the component with LinuxCNC's HAL and gets an ID assigned\nto it. In this example, we'll register a component called hello-comp. This is equivalent to a call\nto hal_init() in C land.\nlet mut builder = HalComponentBuilder::new(\"hello-comp\")?;\n\nNext, we need some pins. We'll create one input and one output called input-1 and output-1\nrespectively. These are the HAL pin names you'll see in LinuxCNC.\nlet input_1 = builder.register_input_pin::&lt;HalPinF64&gt;(\"input-1\")?;\nlet output_1 = builder.register_output_pin::&lt;HalPinF64&gt;(\"output-1\")?;\n\nOnce the pins are registered, the builder can be consumed into a complete HAL component. This step\nsignals to LinuxCNC that the component has registered all pins and is ready to use. It's important\nto note that LinuxCNC will hang if ready() isn't called. In C land, you'd call hal_ready()\nat this point.\nlet comp = builder.ready()?;\n\nHAL pins can't be registered after ready() is called in a component, and we take care of that with\nRust's type system and the type state pattern. The\nbuilder.ready() call above consumes the builder into a HalComponent which doesn't have any way\nto register pins on it, preventing invalid operation order. In a C HAL component, an error is logged\nif you do register a pin after the ready() call and probably lands you in an invalid state. It's\nobviously a lot safer to capture that error at compile time, so we'll let Rust's rich type system\nhelp out here. Yay Rust!\nAnyway, now we're initialised, let's start the main control loop of the component. We'll check\ncomp.should_exit() every iteration to see if a Unix signal has been received from LinuxCNC asking\nthe component to quit.\nlet start = Instant::now();\n\nwhile !comp.should_exit() {\n    let time = start.elapsed().as_secs() as i32;\n\n    output_1.set_value(time.into())?;\n\n    println!(\"Input: {:?}\", input_1.value());\n\n    thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));\n}\n\nThis simple loop sets the output-1 pin's value to the current elapsed time in seconds every\niteration. It also prints the value of input-1 to the console. If you hook input-1 up to, say,\nthe spindle.0.speed-out pin in a .hal file, you should see the spindle RPM value printed to the\nconsole.\nSo as not to lag LinuxCNC up too much, we call thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000)) to\npoll/update the pins every second. This delay can be made shorter for a more responsive component.\nAn emergency stop control would need to respond much faster than 1 second!\nThe above loop will cycle forever until a SIGTERM, SIGINT or SIGKILL signal is received.\nLinuxCNC will send one of these on shutdown, ending the loop. Once the loop is over the component\nshould exit with a success status. Add the following to the bottom of main():\nOk(())\n\nAt this point in C, you'd have to remember to call hal_exit. Not too hard, but it's possible to\nforget. With linuxcnc-hal there's a custom Drop impl for HalComponent. It automatically calls\nhal_exit for you when it goes out of scope at the end of the program. Rust lets us be lazy and\nsafe. Noice.\nIf the above is difficult to follow, here's the complete and final src/main.rs:\nuse linuxcnc_hal::{hal_pin::HalPinF64, HalComponentBuilder};\nuse std::{\n    error::Error,\n    thread,\n    time::{Duration, Instant},\n};\n\nfn main() -&gt; Result&lt;(), Box&lt;dyn Error&gt;&gt; {\n    let mut builder = HalComponentBuilder::new(\"hello-comp\")?;\n\n    let input_1 = builder.register_input_pin::&lt;HalPinF64&gt;(\"input-1\")?;\n\n    let output_1 = builder.register_output_pin::&lt;HalPinF64&gt;(\"output-1\")?;\n\n    let comp = builder.ready()?;\n\n    let start = Instant::now();\n\n    while !comp.should_exit() {\n        let time = start.elapsed().as_secs() as i32;\n\n        output_1.set_value(time.into())?;\n\n        println!(\"Input: {:?}\", input_1.value());\n\n        thread::sleep(Duration::from_millis(1000));\n    }\n\n    Ok(())\n}\n\nWith any luck, running cargo build will successfully compile your new component. cargo run is\nunlikely to work, as the raw hal_* functions aren't defined by the crate. They're defined in\nliblinuxcnchal.so which is loaded by LinuxCNC.\nLoading into LinuxCNC\nI'm assuming some basic knowledge of how the LinuxCNC HAL is configured in this section. If you need\na primer, the official LinuxCNC docs are a good place to\nstart. I'm also assuming you have a LinuxCNC config ready to go, either a simulator or a real\nmachine.\n\nDisclaimer: I do not accept responsibility for any loss or injury caused by following this\ntutorial with real hardware. CNC can be dangerous. Use your common sense.\n\nRunning cargo build will create a binary artifact at ./target/debug/hello-comp. We now need to\nhook this into LinuxCNC and wire some pins up using a .hal file.\nTo create a basic .hal config, add the following to hello-comp.hal in the crate root.\nloadusr /full/path/to/comp/target/debug/hello-comp\nnet input-1 spindle.0.speed-out hello-comp.input-1\n\nThe config first loads the component into userspace. We're not creating a realtime component here.\nIt then creates a net called input-1, joining spindle.0.speed-out to the input pin\nhello-comp.input-1.\nAdd this to your machine .ini config like so:\nHALFILE = /full/path/to/comp/hello-comp.hal\n\nYou might get some pin conflicts on startup, so if LinuxCNC crashes check the error messages and fix\nany conflicting pin errors in your .hal files.\nStart LinuxCNC as you normally would. Note that you'll need to run it from the console to see the\ninput pin value printed. With luck, you should see pins.input-1 and pins.output-1 under the\nPins tab of Machine -&gt; Hal Meter. Select pins.output-1 and you should see the current\nelapsed time in seconds.\nFinal Thoughts\nRust's type safety and ownership rules mean we get a safe, easy to use interface to the underlying\nLinuxCNC HAL methods.\nThere's still a lot more left to do on linuxcnc-hal. There isn't a way to register signals yet,\nand a lot of the\nautogenerated methods don't\nhave a safe wrapper yet. That said, hopefully the pins-only interface is useful to see where the\npain points/bugs are in linuxcnc-hal.\nThanks for reading, and happy machining!\nIf you found this article or linuxcnc-hal itself useful, please consider\nbecoming a Github sponsor.

Here's an example that connects\nover I2C and draws some shapes in GraphicsMode for the STM32F103:\n#![no_std]\n#![no_main]\n\nextern crate cortex_m;\nextern crate cortex_m_rt as rt;\nextern crate panic_semihosting;\nextern crate stm32f1xx_hal as hal;\n\nuse cortex_m_rt::{ExceptionFrame, entry, exception};\nuse embedded_graphics::prelude::*;\nuse embedded_graphics::primitives::{Circle, Line, Rect};\nuse hal::i2c::{BlockingI2c, DutyCycle, Mode};\nuse hal::prelude::*;\nuse hal::stm32;\nuse ssd1306::prelude::*;\nuse ssd1306::Builder;\n\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    let dp = stm32::Peripherals::take().unwrap();\n    let mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();\n    let mut rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();\n    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze(&amp;mut flash.acr);\n    let mut afio = dp.AFIO.constrain(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n    let mut gpiob = dp.GPIOB.split(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n    let scl = gpiob.pb8.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\n    let sda = gpiob.pb9.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\n\n    let i2c = BlockingI2c::i2c1(\n        dp.I2C1,\n        (scl, sda),\n        &amp;mut afio.mapr,\n        Mode::Fast {\n            frequency: 400_000,\n            duty_cycle: DutyCycle::Ratio2to1,\n        },\n        clocks,\n        &amp;mut rcc.apb1,\n        1000,\n        10,\n        1000,\n        1000,\n    );\n\n    let mut disp: GraphicsMode&lt;_&gt; = Builder::new().connect_i2c(i2c).into();\n\n    disp.init().unwrap();\n    disp.flush().unwrap();\n\n    disp.draw(\n        Line::new(Coord::new(8, 16 + 16), Coord::new(8 + 16, 16 + 16))\n            .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n            .into_iter(),\n    );\n    disp.draw(\n        Line::new(Coord::new(8, 16 + 16), Coord::new(8 + 8, 16))\n            .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n            .into_iter(),\n    );\n    disp.draw(\n        Line::new(Coord::new(8 + 16, 16 + 16), Coord::new(8 + 8, 16))\n            .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n            .into_iter(),\n    );\n\n    disp.draw(\n        Rect::new(Coord::new(48, 16), Coord::new(48 + 16, 16 + 16))\n            .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n            .into_iter(),\n    );\n\n    disp.draw(\n        Circle::new(Coord::new(96, 16 + 8), 8)\n            .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n            .into_iter(),\n    );\n\n    disp.flush().unwrap();\n\n    loop {}\n}\n\n#[exception]\nfn HardFault(ef: &amp;ExceptionFrame) -&gt; ! {\n    panic!(\"{:#?}\", ef);\n}\n\nFirst, we need to set up the I2C interface. This is pretty standard HAL boilerplate:\nuse cortex_m_rt::{ExceptionFrame, entry, exception};\nuse embedded_graphics::prelude::*;\nuse embedded_graphics::primitives::{Circle, Line, Rect};\nuse hal::i2c::{BlockingI2c, DutyCycle, Mode};\nuse hal::prelude::*;\nuse hal::stm32;\nuse ssd1306::prelude::*;\nuse ssd1306::Builder;\n\n// ...\n\nlet dp = stm32::Peripherals::take().unwrap();\nlet mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();\nlet mut rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();\nlet clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze(&amp;mut flash.acr);\nlet mut afio = dp.AFIO.constrain(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\nlet mut gpiob = dp.GPIOB.split(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\nlet scl = gpiob.pb8.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\nlet sda = gpiob.pb9.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\n\nlet i2c = BlockingI2c::i2c1(\n    dp.I2C1,\n    (scl, sda),\n    &amp;mut afio.mapr,\n    Mode::Fast {\n        frequency: 400_000,\n        duty_cycle: DutyCycle::Ratio2to1,\n    },\n    clocks,\n    &amp;mut rcc.apb1,\n    1000,\n    10,\n    1000,\n    1000,\n);\n\nYou'll need to change this code to work with the device you're using. I'm running the I2C1 interface\nat 400KHz in the example above.\nNext, let's create a display instance, initialise it and clear the display:\nuse ssd1306::prelude::*;\nuse ssd1306::Builder;\n\n// ...\n\nlet mut disp: GraphicsMode&lt;_&gt; = Builder::new().connect_i2c(i2c).into();\n\ndisp.init().unwrap();\ndisp.flush().unwrap();\n\nThis is where we use the\nBuilder pattern to construct\na driver that will talk to the display over I2C. By default, the builder returns a\nRawMode driver which isn't\nvery useful on it's own unless you just want to draw raw pixels. To be able to do more useful\nthings, we'll call .into() which will convert the driver into a richer mode defined by the type of\ndisp. In this case, we want to use GraphicsMode&lt;_&gt; to be able to use all the goodness from the\nembedded_graphics crate.\nThe last step is to initialise and clear the display with disp.init() and disp.flush() (graphics\nmode has an empty display buffer by default).\nNow we can draw some stuff to the display:\n// Triangle\ndisp.draw(\n    Line::new(Coord::new(8, 16 + 16), Coord::new(8 + 16, 16 + 16))\n        .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n        .into_iter(),\n);\ndisp.draw(\n    Line::new(Coord::new(8, 16 + 16), Coord::new(8 + 8, 16))\n        .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n        .into_iter(),\n);\ndisp.draw(\n    Line::new(Coord::new(8 + 16, 16 + 16), Coord::new(8 + 8, 16))\n        .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n        .into_iter(),\n);\n\n// Square\ndisp.draw(\n    Rect::new(Coord::new(48, 16), Coord::new(48 + 16, 16 + 16))\n        .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n        .into_iter(),\n);\n\n// Circle\ndisp.draw(\n    Circle::new(Coord::new(96, 16 + 8), 8)\n        .with_stroke(Some(1u8.into()))\n        .into_iter(),\n);\n\ndisp.flush().unwrap();\n\nThis will draw a triangle, square and circle in roughly the middle of the display.\n\nBufferless\nBecause GraphicsMode is buffered, you need to call disp.flush() to write the buffer to the\ndisplay. It also consumes 1KiB of RAM to hold the buffer which is quite a lot of memory for a µC!\nAnother supported mode is\nTerminalMode,\nimplemented by @therealprof. TerminalMode is an unbuffered\ncharacter output mode that renders only text. It draws from left to right and top to bottom,\nrestarting in the top left corner. It uses a built-in 7x7 font on a fixed 8x8 pixel grid.\nAside from writing raw strings to the display, this mode also supports the core::fmt::Write trait\nso you can call any of the usual Rust output and formatting methods/macros on it. While useful, be\naware that doing so will add a lot of bloat to your binary.\nHere's a small \"Hello World!\" example for the STM32F103, using the SSD1306 via I2C:\n#![no_std]\n#![no_main]\n\nextern crate cortex_m;\nextern crate cortex_m_rt as rt;\nextern crate panic_semihosting;\nextern crate stm32f1xx_hal as hal;\n\nuse core::fmt::Write;\nuse cortex_m_rt::ExceptionFrame;\nuse cortex_m_rt::{entry, exception};\nuse hal::i2c::{BlockingI2c, DutyCycle, Mode};\nuse hal::prelude::*;\nuse hal::stm32;\nuse ssd1306::prelude::*;\nuse ssd1306::Builder;\n\n#[entry]\nfn main() -&gt; ! {\n    let dp = stm32::Peripherals::take().unwrap();\n\n    let mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();\n    let mut rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();\n\n    let clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze(&amp;mut flash.acr);\n\n    let mut afio = dp.AFIO.constrain(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n\n    let mut gpiob = dp.GPIOB.split(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\n\n    let scl = gpiob.pb8.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\n    let sda = gpiob.pb9.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\n\n    let i2c = BlockingI2c::i2c1(\n        dp.I2C1,\n        (scl, sda),\n        &amp;mut afio.mapr,\n        Mode::Fast {\n            frequency: 400_000,\n            duty_cycle: DutyCycle::Ratio2to1,\n        },\n        clocks,\n        &amp;mut rcc.apb1,\n        1000,\n        10,\n        1000,\n        1000,\n    );\n\n    let mut disp: TerminalMode&lt;_&gt; = Builder::new().connect_i2c(i2c).into();\n\n    disp.set_rotation(DisplayRotation::Rotate180).unwrap();\n\n    disp.init().unwrap();\n    disp.clear();\n\n    // Write a string to the display\n    disp.write_str(\"Hello world!\").unwrap();\n\n    // Write a string using the `write!()` macro\n    write!(disp, \"Hello world!\").unwrap();\n}\n\n#[exception]\nfn HardFault(ef: &amp;ExceptionFrame) -&gt; ! {\n    panic!(\"{:#?}\", ef);\n}\n\nYou can find the full example\nhere.\nThere's currently no positioning or scrolling support beyond calling\nclear(),\nbut this mode provides a lighter alternative to a full, buffered GraphicsMode.\nOnwards\nPlease give the driver a try! There are\na bunch of examples in the repo which\nshould be a good starting point.

Please open an issue if you find\na bug or something missing from the crate.

It's available on AliExpress and eBay for peanuts, but is lacking a Rust driver.

Please note that it\ncurrently doesn't use the internal memory of the IC as the display buffer, so could be\nmemory-optimised quite a lot. PRs welcome!\nThe driver currently only supports I2C as I haven't seen many SPI SH1106 modules in the wild, so\nlet's take a look at the code to hook up the display over I2C. I'll draw the Rust logo as seen in\nthe header image in the following example.\nI've left some of the boilerplate out of this code, but you can find the\ncomplete example here.\nuse embedded_graphics::image::Image1BPP;\nuse embedded_graphics::prelude::*;\nuse sh1106::prelude::*;\nuse sh1106::Builder;\n\nlet dp = stm32::Peripherals::take().unwrap();\nlet mut flash = dp.FLASH.constrain();\nlet mut rcc = dp.RCC.constrain();\nlet clocks = rcc.cfgr.freeze(&amp;mut flash.acr);\nlet mut afio = dp.AFIO.constrain(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\nlet mut gpiob = dp.GPIOB.split(&amp;mut rcc.apb2);\nlet scl = gpiob.pb8.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\nlet sda = gpiob.pb9.into_alternate_open_drain(&amp;mut gpiob.crh);\n\nlet i2c = BlockingI2c::i2c1(\n    dp.I2C1,\n    (scl, sda),\n    &amp;mut afio.mapr,\n    Mode::Fast {\n        frequency: 400_000,\n        duty_cycle: DutyCycle::Ratio2to1,\n    },\n    clocks,\n    &amp;mut rcc.apb1,\n    1000,\n    10,\n    1000,\n    1000,\n);\n\nlet mut disp: GraphicsMode&lt;_&gt; = Builder::new().connect_i2c(i2c).into();\n\ndisp.init().unwrap();\ndisp.flush().unwrap();\n\nlet im = Image1BPP::new(include_bytes!(\"./rust.raw\"), 64, 64).translate(Coord::new(32, 0));\n\ndisp.draw(im.into_iter());\n\ndisp.flush().unwrap();\n\nComplete, runnable example\nSimple as that! The image is included with include_bytes!() and is naturally monochrome to suit\nthe display. It should be compressed to 1 bit per pixel, which can be done with the following\nImagemagick command:\nconvert rust.png -depth 1 gray:rust.raw\n\nNow let's break down the example above. First, we need a display in GraphicsMode, so we can draw\nprimitives and images.\nlet mut disp: GraphicsMode&lt;_&gt; = Builder::new().connect_i2c(i2c).into();\n\nThis uses the Builder pattern to connect to the display over I2C. Take a look at the\nBuilder docs for more options\nlike setting display size and rotation. Lastly, we call .into() to convert the display from\nRawMode into GraphicsMode. If you want to just draw individual pixels, skip this step.\nNext, we need to initialise the display with init() and flush() (to clear it).\ndisp.init().unwrap();\ndisp.flush().unwrap();\n\nAnd now, draw the image:\nlet im = Image1BPP::new(include_bytes!(\"./rust.raw\"), 64, 64).translate(Coord::new(32, 0));\n\ndisp.draw(im.into_iter());\n\ndisp.flush().unwrap();\n\nThe image is drawn to the display buffer by using im.into_iter(). embedded-graphics tries hard\nto use as little memory as possible internally, and iterators really help with that! Currently, the\nSH1106 crate uses a framebuffer, but the IC contains its own memory that can be read and written.\nThis means that, in the future, a microcontroller could consume almost no memory when driving this\ndisplay. Awesome. Once the image is in the buffer, a call to disp.flush() sends the buffer to the\nscreen.\nPlease help test this crate out! There are\na few examples that should Just Work on\nan STM32 Blue Pill, but it would be great to test this crate on other devices as well. The SH1106\ncontains a readable framebuffer which the crate currently doesn't use. This wastes a lot of memory\non the microcontroller, so using the builtin framebuffer is a priority for future work.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/electronics/rust/2019/02/13/sh1106-driver.html/","title":"Announcing the SH1106 OLED display driver"},"https://wapl.es/elm/2017/12/12/elm-counting-occurrences.html/":{"body":"So. Elm. It's been an interesting experience for me, coming from a procedural language (JS)\nbackground. The learning curve is steep, but the functional nature of Elm, along with its compile\ntime type safety really pays off. One of the (few!) problems I've found as a newcomer however, is\nthat the documentation can be really frustrating sometimes. In this post, I hope to remedy that\nslightly by providing a newcomer's perspective on a little bit of data processing in Elm.\nHeader photo by @rawpixel\nLet's say I've collected a list of tags from questions on StackOverflow. I want to create a unique\ndictionary of tags and the number of times they occur in the dataset. To do that, we'll need to\nprocess the data from a flat list into a Dict of key/value pairs. The key will be the name of the\ntag, and the value will be the number of occurrences in the dataset.\nStarting at the beginning (whoa)\nFirst, let's just render this List of tags:\ntagList =\n    [ \"elm\"\n    , \"javascript\"\n    , \"javascript\"\n    , \"rust\"\n    , \"elm\"\n    , \"rust\"\n    , \"javascript\"\n    , \"typescript\"\n    ]\n\nCool. We'll store that list in a Model to pass to some rendering layer:\nimport List\n\ntype alias Model =\n    { tagList : List String\n    }\n\n\ninit : ( Model, Cmd Msg )\ninit =\n    ( { tagList =\n            [ \"elm\"\n            , \"javascript\"\n            , \"javascript\"\n            , \"rust\"\n            , \"elm\"\n            , \"rust\"\n            , \"javascript\"\n            , \"typescript\"\n            ]\n      }\n    , Cmd.none\n    )\n\nThis will store the list of tags under model.tagList, which we can use in the view to render a\n(not so) pretty list:\nview : Model -&gt; Html msg\nview model =\n    div []\n        [ section []\n            [ text \"All the tags\"\n            , ul [] (List.map (\\tag -&gt; li [] [ text tag ]) model.tagList)\n            ]\n        ]\n\nThe entire program so far is shown below. It's a pretty standard Elm boilerplate app. The most\ninteresting bits are described above; how we store the list, and how we present it.\n\nGreat, we've got a working Elm program. Next, I'll go into a bit of data processing to turn this\nflat, boring list into a Dict of tags and counts.\nDicts\nAs a first step towards grouping the data, we need to start using a Dict. Dicts contain unique\nkeys with an associated value. They're the same as Map()s in JavaScript. As a first step we'll\njust render a list of unique tags to keep things understandable. The counts will come later.\nFirst, the model type needs to change to use an Elm Dict for our list of tags:\nimport Dict exposing (..)\n\ntype alias Model =\n    { tagList : Dict String Int\n    }\n\ntagList is now of type Dict String Int, which is a map of String keys to Int values. This\nwill hold the tag -&gt; count mapping.\nWe need to write a function to transform the list of tags when the model is initialised, so let's\nwrite that:\nimport Dict exposing (..)\n\n-- ...\n\ngroupTags : List String -&gt; Dict String Int\ngroupTags tags =\n    tags\n        |&gt; List.foldr (\\tag -&gt; Dict.insert tag 0) Dict.empty\n\nThis function will foldr (Array.reduce() in JavaScript parlance) the tag list and create a\nDict. The keys will be the unique list of tags from the input, while the values at the moment\nwill all be 0 for simplicity's sake.\nThe |&gt; is some syntactic sugar. The above is the same as this:\ngroupTags : List String -&gt; Dict String Int\ngroupTags tags =\n    List.foldr (\\tag -&gt; Dict.insert tag 0) Dict.empty tags\n\nThe |&gt; operator \"fills in\" the last argument of List.foldr function with tags.\n\nA quick aside: in\nthe docs for foldr\nyou'll see a signature that looks like this:\nfoldr : (a -&gt; b -&gt; b) -&gt; b -&gt; List a -&gt; b\n\nThis is frustratingly obtuse for a beginner (or at least was for me), so let's rename the\nvariables to make it a bit clearer:\nfoldr : (item -&gt; carry -&gt; carry result) -&gt; initialValue -&gt; inputList -&gt; returnType\n\nThe example in the docs is foldr (+) 0 [1,2,3] == 6. I found this pretty confusing, although\nit's wonderfully concise. Rewritten in longer form, it's a bit more understandable:\nfoldr (\\item carry -&gt; carry + item) 0 [1,2,3] == 6\n\nHope that helps!\n\nAnyway, now we can initialise the model:\ninit : ( Model, Cmd Msg )\ninit =\n    ( { tagList =\n            (groupTags\n                [ \"elm\"\n                , \"javascript\"\n                , \"javascript\"\n                , \"rust\"\n                , \"elm\"\n                , \"rust\"\n                , \"javascript\"\n                , \"typescript\"\n                ]\n            )\n      }\n    , Cmd.none\n    )\n\nFinally, we can change our render method slightly:\nview : Model -&gt; Html msg\nview model =\n    div []\n        [ section []\n            [ text \"My tag list\"\n            , ul []\n                (model.tagList\n                    |&gt; Dict.keys\n                    |&gt; List.map (\\tag -&gt; li [] [ text tag ])\n                )\n            ]\n        ]\n\nAgain, the |&gt; could be written like this:\n(List.map (\\tag -&gt; li [] [ text tag ] (Dict.keys model.tagList)))\n\nYou can see that using the\npipeline operator makes things\nmuch easier to read. Here's a demo:\n\nCounting keys\nThis Dict isn't very useful without some actual data in its keys. To fix that, we need to update\ngroupTags to actually count the number of occurrences instead of just setting each value to 0.\nHere's what it looks like:\ngroupTags : List String -&gt; Dict String Int\ngroupTags tags =\n    tags\n        |&gt; List.foldr\n            (\\tag carry -&gt;\n                Dict.update\n                    tag\n                    (\\existingCount -&gt;\n                        case existingCount of\n                            Just existingCount -&gt;\n                                Just (existingCount + 1)\n\n                            Nothing -&gt;\n                                Just 1\n                    )\n                    carry\n            )\n            Dict.empty\n\nInstead of overwriting existing keys with Dict.insert as before, we're now using Dict.update\nwhich takes three arguments:\n\ntag – they Dict key to search for\nupdateFunc – how to update the Dict\ndictToUpdate – the starting Dict we want to update\n\nIt's important to note that Dict.update will upsert a key; if it doesn't exist, it'll get\ncreated. Dict.update returns a whole new Dict, with the updated/inserted key/value pair. This is\nwhere the second argument (updateFunc) comes into play. It is supplied with one argument,\nexistingCount, which is a Maybe type. If there's no existing key, this will be Nothing,\notherwise you'll get Just &lt;dict value type&gt;. In our case, this would be Just Int. The case\nstatement will add one to an existing value, or insert a new key into the dict with a starting value\nof 1.\nThe last thing we need to do is update the view to render tag counts:\nimport Tuple\n\n-- ...\n\nview : Model -&gt; Html msg\nview model =\n    div []\n        [ section []\n            [ text \"My tag list\"\n            , ul []\n                (model.tagList\n                    |&gt; Dict.toList\n                    |&gt; List.map\n                        (\\pair -&gt;\n                            let\n                                tag =\n                                    Tuple.first pair\n\n                                count =\n                                    toString (Tuple.second pair)\n                            in\n                                li [] [ text (tag ++ \": \" ++ count) ]\n                        )\n                )\n            ]\n        ]\n\nUnfortunately this is a bit involved, because Dict.map takes a Dict, therefore must return a\nDict. We want to return a List of &lt;li&gt; elements, so we can't directly use Dict.map. Argh.\nSo first we turn the Dict into a list of tuples with\nDict.tolist. The data now\nlooks like this:\n[ ( \"elm\", 2 )\n, ( \"javascript\", 3 )\n, ( \"rust\", 2 )\n, ( \"typescript\", 1 )\n]\n\nCool, now it's in a list so we can turn that into a bunch of &lt;li&gt; elements with List.map:\nList.map\n    (\\pair -&gt;\n        let\n            tag =\n                Tuple.first pair\n\n            count =\n                toString (Tuple.second pair)\n        in\n            li [] [ text (tag ++ \": \" ++ count) ]\n    )\n\nBecause this code is looping through a list of tuples, we need to use Tuple.first and\nTuple.second to extract the tag and count respectively. The last bit is to call toString on the\ncount to turn the Int into a String, ready for outputting in HTML.\nNow we've got something that looks like this:\n\nAnd we're done! Well done if you made it down here.\nWrapping up\nHopefully I've helped you understand a bit about how data processing (particularly with Dicts)\nworks in Elm with some practical code. During my Elm learning experience, I found there was a gap\nbetween absolute beginner tutorials and more advanced stuff. Perhaps that's my procedural background\ntalking, or perhaps I just need to be smarter. Who knows, but either way the aim of this article was\nto help bridge this gap. Let me know on Twitter if there's\nsomething I can do to improve this article, and as always, thanks for read'n.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/elm/2017/12/12/elm-counting-occurrences.html/","title":"Elm: counting groups of items in a list"},"https://wapl.es/huanyang-linuxcnc-2-7-speed-control/":{"body":"Huanyang branded VFD drives are ubiquitous on eBay and other sites like AliExpress. I bought one\nsome time ago with a 1.5KW spindle and have been controlling the speed manually with the difficult\nto use control panel on the front. It is, however, possible to control the VFD from within LinuxCNC\nusing the M3 and M5 commands\n(I haven't been able to get M4, reverse rotation, working yet). What's also neat is we can get the\nmachine to wait for the spindle to come up to speed before moving to the next line of GCode.\n\nThe first thing I tried was PDM using\nsignals from the parallel port. This doesn't set the speed accurately at all and the PDM/speed\nconversion curve is hilariously inaccurate. If you want to try this method for whatever reason,\nthere's a\nguide in the LinuxCNC documentation.\nMost Huanyang VFDs have an RS-485 two-wire interface, so let's use this to communicate with the\ndrive from LinuxCNC. These inverters supposedly support Modbus but aren't compliant, so a custom HAL\ncomponent for LinuxCNC is required. Since LinuxCNC 2.7,\nthis component is now bundled with the\ndefault image as a HAL component, so all we need to do is set it up properly. Easy!\nHardware required\n\nA computer running LinuxCNC 2.7+ with at least one USB port\nA USB ↔ RS-485 converter. I got one on eBay for less than a fiver. You could use an RS-232 to\nRS-485 converter too\nHuanyang VFD\nTwo core signal (light gauge) wire to hook up between the VFD and converter. I used one of the\ntwisted pairs out of an ethernet cable. The twistedness might help over very long distances as\nRS-485 is differential. For shop use it doesn't really matter.\n\nVFD configuration\nWe first need to change some settings in the VFD. Most of these settings are identical to those\ndefined in the hy_vfd man page so look there\nif you need more information. Running hy_vfd --help from a terminal will give you the same\nhelptext.\nChange the following registers to make the VFD listen on the RS-485 bus for control signals:\n\nPD001 2 (listen for run commands on the RS-485 bus)\nPD002 2 (listen for frequency/speed commands on the RS-485 bus)\nPD164 3 (baud rate - 38400 baud)\nPD165 3 (communication data method to 8N1 RTU)\n\nCheck your VFD manual for other values for these registers. I've included a PDF of the manual\n[here]({{ site.files }}/hy-vfd-manual.pdf) if you've lost the one included with your VFD.\n\nLinuxCNC Configuration\nFor completeness' sake, I'm making available my entire machine config\n[here]({{ site.files }}/hy-vfd-config-rs485.zip) to help make configuring the VFD clearer if you\nneed it. Read on for step by step config instructions and make reference to the config files in the\ndownload if need be. It's provided purely as an example of what to add to it to get the Huanyang VFD\nworking, so don't use it on your machine verbatim.\nI didn't need most of the signals made available by the hy_vfd module so I didn't add them to the\nconfiguration. You can add them yourself by looking at the HAL meter in LinuxCNC for the names.\nNote: Using stepconf again will overwrite some of your custom settings. The INI and other config\nfiles will have to be edited by hand, which is not that hard. You can always use stepconf to test\nthings without saving and then edit the files manually later.\ncustom.hal\n# Include your customized HAL commands here\n# This file will not be overwritten when you run stepconf again\n\n# Load the Huanyang VFD user component\nloadusr -Wn spindle-vfd hy_vfd -n spindle-vfd -t 1 -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -p none -r 38400 -s 1\n\n#net vfd-comms halui.machine.is-on =&gt; spindle-vfd.enable\nsetp spindle-vfd.enable 1\nnet spindle-fwd motion.spindle-forward =&gt; spindle-vfd.spindle-forward\nnet spindle-reverse motion.spindle-reverse =&gt; spindle-vfd.spindle-reverse\nnet spindle-speed-cmd  motion.spindle-speed-out-abs =&gt; spindle-vfd.speed-command\nnet spindle-on motion.spindle-on =&gt; spindle-vfd.spindle-on\nnet spindle-at-speed motion.spindle-at-speed =&gt; spindle-vfd.spindle-at-speed\n\nIt's worth explaining this line in more detail:\nloadusr -Wn spindle-vfd hy_vfd -n spindle-vfd -t 1 -d /dev/ttyUSB0 -p none -r 38400 -s 1\n\n\nAssumes the serial port is located at /dev/ttyUSB0 (because I'm using a USB converter here).

To do so, modify the machine .ini\nfile. This is the .ini file inside the folder created by Stepconf. If your machine is called\nAllie like mine, this will be Allie/Allie.ini.\nFind the [DISPLAY] section and add the following line to load the custom control panel (assuming\nyou called the file custompanel.xml):\nPYVCP = custompanel.xml\n\nNext, find the [HAL] section and add these lines if they're not already present:\nHALFILE = custom.hal\nPOSTGUI_HALFILE = custom_postgui.hal\n\nUsage\n\nStart LinuxCNC\nYou should see the custom control panel on the right\nHome all axes to allow manual control if required\nGo to the MDI panel (F5) and type M3 S5000 to start the spindle at 5k RPM. Run M5\nto stop. The display on the VFD when set to show frequency should show a value close to 5000 RPM.\nYou should also be able to use M4 (reverse rotation), but you'll need to set PD023 to 1 on\nthe VFD to enable it (untested).\nTo see the spindle-at-speed indicator in action, enter M3 240000 from stopped to see the\nspindle-at-speed LED stay red until 24k RPM is reached after a couple of seconds. It is\nimportant that this works otherwise LinuxCNC won't wait for the spindle to come up to speed before\nstarting a cut.\n\nFinal notes and gotchas\n\nThe VFD takes some time to respond to speed commands. This can be an issue with emergency\nstops because the spindle won't stop until about 2 seconds after the button is pressed. I've\nruined a few tools because of this.\nVFD must be on before you open LinuxCNC, otherwise HAL component will not start comms properly\n(component is loaded at startup and only attempts connection on load)\nI had huge trouble getting the VFD to communicate. Simple solution: make sure spindle-vfd.enable\nis set to 1.\nModbus comms ok LED in PyVCP goes red during run; possibly because bus is busy reporting values\nback or whatever. We don't really care, you just don't want it red when the spindle is stopped.\n\n","id":"https://wapl.es/huanyang-linuxcnc-2-7-speed-control/","title":"Spindle speed control using LinuxCNC 2.7 with a Huanyang inverter"},"https://wapl.es/linux/2018/09/03/linux-mint-19-office-365.html/":{"body":"Office 365 mail, calendar and notifications in Linux Mint 19\n\nInstall Evolution with the Exchange addons\n\napt install evolution evolution-ews evolution-plugins\n\n\n\nAdd your Exchange account by going to Settings -&gt; Online Accounts and selecting\nMicrosoft Exchange.\n\n\nYou may need to use an App Password in Office 365 if required by your domain admin.

To that end, I've been working on a small Rust\nproject at TotallyMoney.com (where I work) for the last week or so to\nsee if it's viable for production use. It's a simple service that polls a\nLogentries endpoint for JSON, parses it and saves some values in a\nPostgres database. It's not a very complicated task, but I saw this as a good opportunity to try\nRust in a production-ish role.\nHeader photo by Sandra Starke\n\nNote: I could very well have written this in NodeJS like the rest of the app it fits into, but I\nwanted to learn Rust a little better. The memory safety of Rust is somewhat lost on this task but\nit's interesting how the language handles errors and optional types. Read on for more.\n\nI'm not very good at Rust (yet), so I may be writing terrible Rust code. Let me know\n@jam_waffles if I've made any glaring mistakes!\nDependencies\nI'm assuming you've got Rust, Cargo and a project folder (cargo init --bin will do) set up for\nthis project. I'm going to use the following crates:\n\nhyper; HTTP library for making GET requests to Logentries\nchrono; Date and time, we'll be using it to store the log entry timestamp\ntime; More date and time, used in this case for sleeping for a certain number of milliseconds\nrustc_serialize; JSON parsing\n\nMy Cargo.toml looks like this:\n[package]\nname = \"logentries_poller\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [\"James Waples &lt;jamwaffles@gmail.com&gt;\"]\n\n[dependencies]\nhyper = \"^0.8.1\"\nrustc-serialize = \"^0.3.19\"\nchrono = \"^0.2\"\ntime = \"^0.1\"\n\nCrates will be installed/updated when you run cargo build or cargo run for the first time.\nPretty neat!\nFetching Logentries data\nFirst, we need to fetch some stuff from Logentries to parse. Logentries provides a simple GET\nendpoint which returns lines of a particular log. Their\ndocumentation specifies the URL as something like this:\nhttps://pull.logentries.com/YOUR_LOGENTRIES_ACCOUNT_KEY/hosts/YOUR_LOG_SET_NAME/YOUR_LOG_NAME/?start=-10000\n\nFor our purposes we only want the last 10 seconds of data (?start=-10000). The code will poll\nLogentries every 5 seconds, so requesting the last 10 seconds worth of data will provide a crude\nmechanism to deal with failures.\nLet's write some Rust. Put this in src/main.rs:\nextern crate hyper;\n\nuse hyper::{ Client };\n\nfn main() {\n\t// Create new Hyper HTTP client\n\tlet client = Client::new();\n\n\t// We're going to request JSON from Logentries here:\n\tlet url = \"https://pull.logentries.com/cafebabe-cafe-babe-cafe-babecafebabe/hosts/My.Log/logset/?start=-10000&amp;filter=src:HddRestGateway\";\n\n\t// Make the request. This will quit if there is some kind of failure\n\tlet response = match client.get(url).send() {\n\t\tOk(response) =&gt; response,\n\t\tErr(e) =&gt; panic!(\"Could not fetch Logentries data: {}\", e)\n\t};\n\n\t// Turn response into stream so we can parse it line by line\n\tlet reader = BufReader::new(response);\n\n\t// Go through each line in the result and just print it for now\n\tfor reader_line in reader.lines() {\n\t\t// Get string result from `Result&lt;&gt;` container\n\t\t// (assumes line always has a value)\n\t\tlet line = reader_line.unwrap();\n\n\t\tprintln!(\"{}\", line);\n\t}\n}\n\nTry running the code with cargo run. With any luck, you should have the last 10 seconds worth of\nLogentries submissions printed in your console. In my case, I see lines like this:\n2016-04-26 15:18:23.1185 | lvl:INFO | ------------ src:HddRestGateway | { \"message\": { \"status\": \"Success\", \"elapsed\": 1089 } }\n2016-04-26 15:17:53.9890 | lvl:INFO | ------------ src:HddRestGateway | { \"message\": { \"status\": \"NotFound\", \"elapsed\": 2443 } }\n2016-04-26 15:17:56.8014 | lvl:INFO | ------------ src:HddRestGateway | { \"message\": { \"status\": \"Success\", \"elapsed\": 1375 } }\n2016-04-26 15:17:38.9468 | lvl:INFO | ------------ src:HddRestGateway | { \"message\": { \"status\": \"Timeout\", \"elapsed\": 5897 } }\n2016-04-26 15:18:38.6810 | lvl:INFO | ------------ src:HddRestGateway | { \"message\": { \"status\": \"NotFound\", \"elapsed\": 1100 } }\n2016-04-26 15:17:52.6964 | lvl:INFO | ------------ src:HddRestGateway | { \"message\": { \"status\": \"Success\", \"elapsed\": 2246 } }\n2016-04-26 15:18:14.7228 | lvl:INFO | ------------ src:HddRestGateway | { \"message\": { \"status\": \"Success\", \"elapsed\": 2987 } }\n\nThe rest of the code in this article assumes the data is in this format. It should be reasonably\nsimple to change the code to suit your needs. Once we have the log output, it's just a matter of\nparsing strings however you see fit.\nFiltering and parsing each line\nEach line contains some fields separated by a pipe character, the first of which is a timestamp and\nthe latter of which is some JSON data. We're not interested in any of the other bits. We're also\nonly interested in log lines with { \"status\": \"Success\" }, so we'll do some simple filtering after\nparsing the line.\nOur program now becomes the following:\nextern crate hyper;\nextern crate chrono;\nextern crate time;\nextern crate rustc_serialize;\n\nuse std::thread;\nuse std::env;\nuse std::time::Duration;\nuse chrono::{ DateTime };\nuse std::error::Error;\nuse rustc_serialize::json::Json;\nuse std::io::{ BufReader, BufRead };\nuse hyper::{ Client };\n\nfn main() {\n\t// Create new Hyper HTTP client\n\tlet client = Client::new();\n\n\t// We're going to request JSON from Logentries here:\n\tlet url = \"https://pull.logentries.com/cafebabe-cafe-babe-cafe-babecafebabe/hosts/My.Log/logset/?start=-10000&amp;filter=src:HddRestGateway\";\n\n\t// Make the request.

The code\nabove deals with a lot of Result&lt;&gt; and Option&lt;&gt; types, which return Ok() or Err() and\nSome() or None() respectively. Rust checks at compile time to make sure we're matching every\npossible return type, meaning we have to handle the Err() or None() cases in the code above.\nSometimes that means setting a sensible default (0 for elapsed time, for example) or continueing\nif the code can't do anything proper with the current line. This code is going to run as a\npersistent service so it makes sense to continue or otherwise bail on processing the current line\ninstead of, say, panic!ing and quitting the program.\nRunning the program again with cargo run, you should see something like the following:\n------ Status: Success, elapsed time: 1089ms at 2016-04-26 15:18:23.1185\nIgnoring status NotFound\n------ Status: Success, elapsed time: 1375ms at 2016-04-26 15:17:56.8014\nIgnoring status Timeout\nIgnoring status NotFound\n------ Status: Success, elapsed time: 2246ms at 2016-04-26 15:17:52.6964\n------ Status: Success, elapsed time: 2987ms at 2016-04-26 15:18:14.7228\n\nFurther explanation\nCode comments aren't very good for learning a language by example, so I'll explain some of the code\nabove.\nFirst, we need to fetch some data from Logentries, in this case using the Hyper HTTP library.\n// Create new Hyper HTTP client\nlet client = Client::new();\n\n// Make the request. This will quit if there is some kind of failure\nlet response = match client.get(url).send() {\n\tOk(response) =&gt; response,\n\tErr(e) =&gt; panic!(\"Could not fetch Logentries data: {}\", e)\n};\n\nHyper's client.get(url).send() reutrns a Result&lt;&gt; which we're matching on. If the request\nfails, it returns Result&lt;Err&gt; which we're handling by panic!()ing as there's no clean way to\nrecover from a failed request (ok so we could just try again using an exponential falloff but let's\nkeep things simple). If we get a Result&lt;Ok&gt;, we return the HTTP response from the match and\nstore it in response for use later.\n+++\nNext, we turn the HTTP response into a BufReader stream. This step isn't necessary but it might\nmake parsing a little faster if the HTTP response can be streamed, although I haven't looked into\nit.\n// Turn response into stream so we can parse it line by line\nlet reader = BufReader::new(response);\n\n+++\nLet's get a timestamp. Logentries (at least in my case) outputs timestamps formatted in a\nnon-standard way, specifically in the milliseconds part. The last part of the stamp is 4 digits long\n(tens of microseconds or something?) however Rust's %f\ndate format placeholder\nexpects 8 digits, so I'm going to add those on as a string literal along with a fake timezone.\nIf someone can point out a better way of parsing a timestamp like 2016-04-26 15:18:23.1185 using\nDateTime or the chrono crate, please let me know.\n// First item is timestamp. Turn it into a Chrono::DateTime\nlet created = match parts.first() {\n\tSome(created) =&gt; {\n\t\tlet mut padded = String::from(*created);\n\n\t\t// Logentries prints the date in a stupid format (or at least one Chrono\n\t\t// can't parse), so let's add some zeroes and a fake timezone\n\t\tpadded.push_str(\"0000+0000\");\n\n\t\tmatch DateTime::parse_from_str(padded.as_str(), \"%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S.%f%z\") {\n\t\t\tOk(parsed) =&gt; parsed,\n\n\t\t\t// If there's a parse error, don't do anything else with this line\n\t\t\tErr(_) =&gt; continue,\n\t\t}\n\t},\n\n\t// No timestamp, must be a bad record, skip remaining processing for this line\n\tNone =&gt; continue\n};\n\nNotice the nested match statements in the code above. If everything goes well and we go down the\nSome(created) and Ok(parsed) branches, that parsed date will be assigned to created at the top\nlevel.\nFinally, if there's an error, the code will call continue which skips the remaining iteration of\nthe loop and moves straight on to the next.\nThe rest of the code is similar to the above examples in terms of how match is utilised.\nConclusions and next steps\nRust's strict type system caused me quite a bit of friction coming from a loosely-typed Node\necosystem, but once you get the hang of it the compile time checking and comprehensive, required\nerror handling makes for very safe code. You'll notice above that only one variable is mutable.\nI'm not doing anything fancy with pointers so it doesn't add much for memory safety, but it allows\nthe compiler to make sure I'm not doing anything stupid reassigning variables and such.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/rust/2016/04/26/rust-logentries-docker.html/","title":"Parsing Logentries output safely using Rust"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2016/10/24/rust-christmas-colour-wheel.html/":{"body":"Here's a quick one; I'm making a Christmas display out of a bunch of serially controllable APA106\nRGB LEDs, but how do I turn a value of 0 – 255 into a glorious RGW (Red Green White) struct with\nthe correct colour, and the correct wrapping rules?\nFirst, some theory\nThe code in the next section is based on the RGB linear colour wheel approximation from the\nAdafruit NeoPixel library.\nSo that I can make modifications to the generated colours, it helps to first visualise the RGB\nbrightnesses against time. For a rainbow RGB pattern, that looks a bit like this:\n\nWe'll get onto the RGW stuff in a sec.\nCode\nI'm writing this project in Rust, however my code is modified from\nthe original RGB wheel C code from Adafruit.\nRGB\nHere's what the reference RGB function looks like in C:\nuint32_t Wheel(byte WheelPos) {\n\tWheelPos = 255 - WheelPos;\n\tif(WheelPos &lt; 85) {\n\t\treturn strip.Color(255 - WheelPos * 3, 0, WheelPos * 3);\n\t}\n\tif(WheelPos &lt; 170) {\n\t\tWheelPos -= 85;\n\t\treturn strip.Color(0, WheelPos * 3, 255 - WheelPos * 3);\n\t}\n\tWheelPos -= 170;\n\treturn strip.Color(WheelPos * 3, 255 - WheelPos * 3, 0);\n}\n\nEasy stuff. It's not perfect because it's linear instead of sinusoidal as we saw in the graph above,\nbut it makes a good enough approximation for fading some LEDs over the rainbow. And it uses simple\ninteger maths which is nice and fast.\nThis is what the same thing (still RGB) looks like in Rust:\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\npub struct Apa106Led {\n\tpub red: u8,\n\tpub green: u8,\n\tpub blue: u8,\n}\n\npub fn rgb_wheel(wheelpos: u8) -&gt; Apa106Led {\n\tlet mut thingy = wheelpos;\n\n\tif thingy &lt; 85 {\n\t\tApa106Led { red: thingy * 3, green: 255 - thingy * 3, blue: 0 }\n\t} else if thingy &lt; 170 {\n\t\tthingy -= 85;\n\n\t\tApa106Led { red: 255 - thingy * 3, green: 0, blue: thingy * 3 }\n\t} else {\n\t\tthingy -= 170;\n\n\t\tApa106Led { red: 0, green: thingy * 3, blue: 255 - thingy * 3 }\n\t}\n}\n\nNote that I'm using a struct to return the values because Rust is cool, and structs are cool.\nChrismus – RGW\nApparently the colours of Christmas are red, green and white. To this end, we need to make a slight\nmodification to our wheel function to fade through white instead of blue:\n\nThere's one caveat to this algorithm: between white and red, there's this wishy washy pink colour\nthat shows up. It's not that bad, but on my LED display it looks odd due to the other colours being\nreasonably well saturated.\nThe code to do this looks like the following:\n// Red - green - white colour wheel\npub fn christmas_wheel(wheelpos: u8) -&gt; Apa106Led {\n\tlet mut thingy = wheelpos;\n\n\t// Ramp red down to 0, green up to 255\n\tif thingy &lt; 85 {\n\t\tApa106Led { red: 255 - thingy * 3, green: thingy * 3, blue: 0 }\n\t} else if thingy &lt; 170 {\t// Ramp red and blue up, leave green at 255\n\t\tthingy -= 85;\n\n\t\tApa106Led { red: thingy * 3, green: 255, blue: thingy * 3 }\n\t} else {\t\t// Ramp green and blue down, leave red at 255\n\t\tthingy -= 170;\n\n\t\tApa106Led { red: 255, green: 255 - thingy * 3, blue: 255 - thingy * 3 }\n\t}\n}\n\nProper wrapping was a bit hard to figure out because red is the only colour that wraps.

I use Linux Mint nearly all\nthe time, so building for macOS targets has required asking very nicely to borrow a spare Macbook\nAir. This is naturally a bit crap, so I set out to find a Linux-only solution to cross compile for\nmacOS using osxcross. A weekend of pain later, and I\nhave the following post. Hopefully it spares you a weekend of your own pain.\nEnvironment\nThis process should work in any modern-ish Debian-based environment. This is the setup I used:\n\nLinux Mint 19.1, Dell XPS1 15, Intel i9 x64\nRust 1.32.0 (with Rustup)\nClang 6.0.0\n\nI've also tested this process in CircleCI and it seems to be working fine.\nThe only device I have to test on at time of writing is a Macbook Air with macOS Mojave on it. This\nprocess should work for other macOS versions, but is untested.\nRequirements\nThere are a few system dependencies required to work with osxcross. I don't think the version\nrequirements are too strict for the packages listed below. You may want to check the\nosxcross requirements as well if you're\nhaving problems.\n# Install build dependencies\napt install \\\n    clang \\\n    gcc \\\n    g++ \\\n    zlib1g-dev \\\n    libmpc-dev \\\n    libmpfr-dev \\\n    libgmp-dev\n\n# Add macOS Rust target\nrustup target add x86_64-apple-darwin\n\nBuilding osxcross\nThe following process is based on\nthis tutorial on Reddit\nand some trial and error. I'm using the macOS 10.10 SDK as I had the least problems getting up and\nrunning with it.\nAdd the following to a script called osxcross_setup.sh and make it executable.\ngit clone https://github.com/tpoechtrager/osxcross\ncd osxcross\nwget -nc https://s3.dockerproject.org/darwin/v2/MacOSX10.10.sdk.tar.xz\nmv MacOSX10.10.sdk.tar.xz tarballs/\nUNATTENDED=yes OSX_VERSION_MIN=10.7 ./build.sh\n\nNot a lot to it, thanks to the hard work put in by the osxcross developers. Running\n./osxcross_setup.sh should create a folder named osxcross with everything you need in it to\ncross compile to macOS with Clang. This doesn't modify $PATH or install any system files, so is\nuseful for CI as well.\nAppend ./build_gcc.sh to osxcross_setup.sh if you want to use GCC to cross compile.\nConfiguring Cargo\nCargo needs to be told to use the correct linker for the x86_64-apple-darwin target, so add the\nfollowing to your project's .cargo/config file:\n[target.x86_64-apple-darwin]\nlinker = \"x86_64-apple-darwin14-clang\"\nar = \"x86_64-apple-darwin14-ar\"\n\nIf you've used a different macOS SDK version, you might need to replace darwin14 with darwin15.\nTo check what binary to use, look in osxcross/target/bin.\nBuilding the project\nBecause I chose not to install osxcross at the system level, the $PATH variable must be modified\nfor Cargo to pick up the linker binaries specified previously. The build command changes to:\n# Add --release to build in release mode\nPATH=\"$(pwd)/osxcross/target/bin:$PATH\" \\\ncargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin\n\nThis adds [pwd]/osxcross/target/bin to $PATH, which means the linker binaries should get picked\nup. The path must be absolute to work properly, hence $(pwd).\nNow you should have a binary in target/x86_64-apple-darwin/[debug|release] which works on macOS!\nBuilding *-sys crates\nYou can stop here if none of your crates require any C bindings to function. Quite a few of them do,\nso read on if you run into compilation or linking errors.\nThe project I'm cross compiling uses the git2 crate which has\nlibz-sys in its dependency tree. Unfortunately this means\ndigging out a C compiler. The build uses the host system compiler by default, so the architectures\nfor the final binary (target arch) and these linked libraries (host arch) don't match up.\nThe solution to this is to set the CC and CXX environment variables in our build command:\nPATH=\"$(pwd)/osxcross/target/bin:$PATH\" \\\nCC=o64-clang \\\nCXX=o64-clang++ \\\ncargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin\n\nThis uses o64-clang and o64-clang++ in osxcross/target/bin.\nNow git2 compiles, but fails to link! This is due to the fact that libz-sys attempts to link to the\nhost system zlib library. Because I'm building on a Linux machine, this is a Linux-native library\nwhich won't work on macOS.\nLuckily, libz-sys supports building its own statically linked version of zlib. According to\nlibz-sys' build.rs, if\nLIBZ_SYS_STATIC=1 is set in the environment a bundled version of zlib will be built. Because we\nset CC and CXX, this statically linked code will be compiled for a macOS target. The full build\ncommand ends up looking like this:\nPATH=\"$(pwd)/osxcross/target/bin:$PATH\" \\\nCC=o64-clang \\\nCXX=o64-clang++ \\\nLIBZ_SYS_STATIC=1 \\\ncargo build --target x86_64-apple-darwin\n\nCI\nI got the above process working in CircleCI, but it should be pretty easy to get any Debian-based CI\nservice to work.\nIt should be possible to cache the osxcross folder so it doesn't have to be built for every job.\nThe cache should be invalidated when your build script(s) change. For example, I use the cache\nchecksum project-v1-{{ \"{{\" }} checksum \"osxcross_setup.sh\" }} to ensure the osxcross folder is\nregenerated correctly.\nWrapping up\nThe final build command is pretty long, so I'd suggest putting it in a script. In my case, I have a\nbuild script containing the following snippet:\n# ... snip ...\n\nMACOS_TARGET=\"x86_64-apple-darwin\"\n\necho \"Building target for platform ${MACOS_TARGET}\"\necho\n\n# Add osxcross toolchain to path\nexport PATH=\"$(pwd)/osxcross/target/bin:$PATH\"\n\n# Make libz-sys (git2-rs -&gt; libgit2-sys -&gt; libz-sys) build as a statically linked lib\n# This prevents the host zlib from being linked\nexport LIBZ_SYS_STATIC=1\n\n# Use Clang for C/C++ builds\nexport CC=o64-clang\nexport CXX=o64-clang++\n\ncargo build --release --target \"${MACOS_TARGET}\"\n\necho\necho Done\n\nNow you can just run ./osxcross_setup.sh and ./build_macos.sh in your CI.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/02/17/rust-cross-compile-linux-to-macos.html/","title":"Cross compiling Rust from Linux to macOS"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/03/04/embedded-graphics-0.4.7-bmp-support.html/":{"body":"Embedded graphics 0.4.7 has been released, along with\na new sister crate, tinybmp!

It's defined in TinyBMP's Cargo.toml like this:\n[dependencies.nom]\nversion = \"4.2.1\"\ndefault-features = false\n\nThe parser is pretty simple. BMP data is little-endian encoded, so we can use Nom's le_u16 and\nle_u32 to parse all the fields out with a function called parse_header:\nnamed!(parse_header&lt;&amp;[u8], Header&gt;,\n    do_parse!(\n        // \"Magic bytes\" marker for BMP files\n        tag!(\"BM\") &gt;&gt;\n        file_size: le_u32 &gt;&gt;\n        reserved_1: le_u16 &gt;&gt;\n        reserved_2: le_u16 &gt;&gt;\n        image_data_start: le_u32 &gt;&gt;\n        // Skip 4 bytes: Remaining header length in bytes\n        le_u32 &gt;&gt;\n        image_width: le_u32 &gt;&gt;\n        image_height: le_u32 &gt;&gt;\n        // Skip 4 bytes: Number of color planes\n        le_u16 &gt;&gt;\n        bpp: le_u16 &gt;&gt;\n        // Skip 4 bytes: Compression method used\n        le_u32 &gt;&gt;\n        image_data_len: le_u32 &gt;&gt;\n        // Skip other fields here\n        (Header{\n            file_type: FileType::BM,\n            file_size,\n            reserved_1,\n            reserved_2,\n            image_data_start: image_data_start as usize,\n            image_width,\n            image_height,\n            image_data_len,\n            bpp\n        })\n    )\n);\n\nThis takes a slice (&amp;[u8]) and produces a Header struct from the first few bytes of it. It\nshould be pretty self explanatory, but I'll address some odd parts of the code above.\n\ntag!(\"BM\") This is the \"magic bytes\" BM marker for BMP files, and must be present for the BMP\nto be valid.\nLines with a lonesome le_u16 or le_u32 simply skip ahead 2 or 4 bytes respectively. This will\nbe a field in the header that we want to ignore.\n\nThe Header struct is all we need to parse from the BMP file to be able to use it. On 32 bit\nsystems (i.e. ARM MCUs, other embedded devices), Header only\nrequires 28 bytes of RAM.\nNice!\nBitmap information\nBMP pixel data is pretty unremarkable, the only caveat being that the Y values are inverted, with\nthe bottom row at the start of the data. Pixel values are stored in little-endian order in whatever\nbit depth is specified in the header. This will commonly be 32 or 24 bits, but 16, 8 or even 1BPP is\nsupported by the BMP format. Currently, only 8 and 16 BPP images are supported by Embedded\nGraphics. If you'd like to see other bit-depths supported, please\nopen an issue!\nContaining everything\nThe other data type exported by TinyBMP is the\nBmp struct:\n/// A BMP-format bitmap\n#[derive(Debug, Clone, PartialEq)]\npub struct Bmp&lt;'a&gt; {\n    /// Image header\n    pub header: Header,\n\n    image_data: &amp;'a [u8],\n}\n\nThis is how you should use TinyBMP, namely with the\nfrom_slice method:\n/// Create a bitmap object from a byte array\n///\n/// This method keeps a slice of the original input and does not dynamically allocate memory.\n/// The input data must live for as long as this BMP instance does.\npub fn from_slice(bytes: &amp;'a [u8]) -&gt; Result&lt;Self, ()&gt; {\n    let (_remaining, header) = parse_header(bytes).map_err(|_| ())?;\n\n    let image_data = &amp;bytes[header.image_data_start..];\n\n    Ok(Bmp { header, image_data })\n}\n\nThis method takes a slice representing a complete BMP file and creates a Bmp from it. The header\nis parsed and a sub-slice of the input data is kept in the image_data field, based on the\nimage_data_start field from the header.\nKeeping with the no_std, low-memory-usage theme,\nBmp only consumes 48 bytes of memory!\nBear in mind the playground uses 64 bit Rust (I think), so memory usage on a 32 bit ARM\nmicrocontroller might even be a bit less. The original bitmap data must be kept somewhere of course,\nbut this works well with include_bytes!() in and embedded context; include_bytes!() data is kept\nin flash memory, leaving precious RAM available for your application. Microcontrollers generally\nhave a lot more flash than RAM, so it's sensible to store large byte arrays in flash.\nEmbedded Graphics\nTinyBMP exposes BMP image data through the\nimage_data() method on\nBmp. We can use this image data to form an Image iterator for Embedded Graphics to use.\nThe struct\nFirst, let's define ImageBmp that wraps a Bmp file with some extra data to allow for cool\nEmbedded Graphics things like transforms:\n/// BMP format image\n#[derive(Debug, Clone)]\npub struct ImageBmp&lt;'a, C: PixelColor&gt; {\n    bmp: Bmp&lt;'a&gt;,\n\n    /// Top left corner offset from display origin (0,0)\n    pub offset: Coord,\n\n    pixel_type: PhantomData&lt;C&gt;,\n}\n\nPixelColor will be used a bit later to make ImageBmp compatible with multiple pixel types.\nYou can read the entire source for ImageBmp\nhere.\nI'll only cover some parts of it to keep this post to a reasonable length.\nIterator setup\nNow we have an ImageBmp, we need to get an iterator for it so the pixel data can be used by\nEmbedded Graphics-compatible libraries. This can be done by creating ImageBmpIterator and\nimplementing IntoIterator for ImageBmp:\n#[derive(Debug)]\npub struct ImageBmpIterator&lt;'a, C: 'a&gt;\nwhere\n    C: PixelColor,\n{\n    x: u32,\n    y: u32,\n    im: &amp;'a ImageBmp&lt;'a, C&gt;,\n    image_data: &amp;'a [u8],\n}\n\nimpl&lt;'a, C&gt; IntoIterator for &amp;'a ImageBmp&lt;'a, C&gt;\nwhere\n    C: PixelColor + From&lt;u8&gt; + From&lt;u16&gt;,\n{\n    type Item = Pixel&lt;C&gt;;\n    type IntoIter = ImageBmpIterator&lt;'a, C&gt;;\n\n    fn into_iter(self) -&gt; Self::IntoIter {\n        ImageBmpIterator {\n            im: self,\n            image_data: self.bmp.image_data(),\n            x: 0,\n            y: 0,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nimage_data uses the Bmp::image_data() method mentioned above. Note that everything uses\nreferences to the original data, meaning no new allocations of huge amounts of pixel data.\nI'm also adding From&lt;u8&gt; + From&lt;u16&gt; as trait bounds for reasons that will become clear in the\nnext section.\nThe iterator\nThis is the most important part of the compatibility between Embedded Graphics and TinyBMP - the\niterator implementation. It's responsible for iterating over the BMP pixel data correctly (remember\nthat it starts from the bottom up) as well as converting 8 or 16 bit words into the correct\nPixelColor*. This is what it looks like:\nimpl&lt;'a, C&gt; Iterator for ImageBmpIterator&lt;'a, C&gt;\nwhere\n    C: PixelColor + From&lt;u8&gt; + From&lt;u16&gt;,\n{\n    type Item = Pixel&lt;C&gt;;\n\n    fn next(&amp;mut self) -&gt; Option&lt;Self::Item&gt; {\n        let current_pixel = loop {\n            let w = self.im.bmp.width();\n            let h = self.im.bmp.height();\n            let x = self.x;\n            let y = self.y;\n\n            // End iterator if we've run out of stuff\n            if x &gt;= w || y &gt;= h {\n                return None;\n            }\n\n            let offset = ((h - 1 - y) * w) + x;\n\n            let bit_value = if self.im.bmp.bpp() == 8 {\n                self.image_data[offset as usize] as u16\n            } else if self.im.bmp.bpp() == 16 {\n                let offset = offset * 2; // * 2 as two bytes per pixel\n\n                (self.image_data[offset as usize] as u16)\n                    | ((self.image_data[(offset + 1) as usize] as u16) &lt;&lt; 8)\n            } else {\n                panic!(\"Bit depth {} not supported\", self.im.bmp.bpp());\n            };\n\n            let current_pixel = self.im.offset + Coord::new(x as i32, y as i32);\n\n            // Increment stuff\n            self.x += 1;\n\n            // Step down a row if we've hit the end of this one\n            if self.x &gt;= w {\n                self.x = 0;\n                self.y += 1;\n            }\n\n            if current_pixel[0] &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; current_pixel[1] &gt;= 0 {\n                break Pixel(current_pixel.to_unsigned(), bit_value.into());\n            }\n        };\n\n        Some(current_pixel)\n    }\n}\n\n(it could probably stand to be optimised a bit. PRs welcome!)\nThis function is responsible for stepping through on screen pixels; a translation may put some of\nthe image off the top left corner of the screen, so those pixels must be skipped. This is why most\nof the function body is wrapped in a loop.\nFor each pixel coordinate, either 1 (for 8BPP) or two (for 16BPP) bytes are taken from the image\ndata and cast to a u16.\nIf the pixel has positive coordinates, it's position and colour are returned. This is where the\nFrom&lt;u8&gt; + From&lt;u16&gt; bounds come in - they allow bit_value.into() to cast the pixel value into\nthe correct PixelColor* used in calling code. I'll explain that better in the next section.\nAn example\nLet's walk through some of the steps to display this image on an embedded display:\n\nThe SSD1331 crate uses the new TinyBMP support in Embedded\nGraphics to draw colour images like the one in the header for this post. The SSD1331 is a 16 bit\ncolour display. It requires pixel data to be sent to it as 16 bit words split into 5 red, 6 green\nand 5 blue colour bits. This works nicely as we can use\nPixelColorU16\nto iterate over an image correctly.\nFirst, we need an RGB565 image. The GIMP can export these quite easily - go to File -&gt; Export As or\npress Shift + Ctrl + E and save as a file ending in .bmp. The BMP\nexport options dialog will now show up. Make sure you choose Advanced Options -&gt; 16 bits -&gt;\nR5 G6 B5 option when exporting:\n\nNow we have a 16 bit BMP, it can be loaded into a Rust program using include_bytes!(), like this:\nuse embedded_graphics::image::ImageBmp;\nuse embedded_graphics::prelude::*;\n\nlet im = ImageBmp::new(include_bytes!(\"./awesome-image.bmp\")).unwrap();\n\nim can now be used to draw to a display compatible with Embedded Graphics with a simple\ndisp.draw(im.into_iter()) command. There's a complete example\nhere in the SSD1331 examples folder\nif you want to see a complete program.\nBecause Rust is awesome, it should be able to figure out whether you intended to use PixelColourU8\nor PixelColorU16 based on the type of pixel the display driver uses. 8BPP BMP images will be\nconverted to either type, and 16BPP BMP images will automatically convert two-byte words into a\nPixelColorU16 which should make more images compatible with more displays.\nAnd that's it! BMP support is great for Embedded Graphics, as it's now far simpler to work with\nimages that are used in embedded projects. Hell, it's even just nice to get an image preview in the\nfile browser! More image formats will be added in the future, namely ones that support simple\ncompression like TGA et al, so stay tuned.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/03/04/embedded-graphics-0.4.7-bmp-support.html/","title":"Embedded Graphics 0.4.7 and TinyBMP 0.1.0"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2019/06/03/diesel-and-tower-web.html/":{"body":"We're building a new product at work, for which we've decided to use Rust\nand tower-web for the backend.

Conventional triangle sorting algorithms use the dot product of two vectors to\ndetermine order, which typically requires a tan() call (I think? What do I look like, a\nmathsologist?) so we'll have to find a different solution.\nLuckily, there's an integer-only method as described in\nthis Stackoverflow answer to sort two points by angle.\nWe can use this sorting function as a predicate to the builtin sort_unstable_by method in Rust,\nbut we need to make a few changes first.\nThis is the original C(++?) from https://stackoverflow.com/a/6989383/383609:\nbool sort_clockwise(point a, point b, point center)\n{\n    if (a.x - center.x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x &lt; 0)\n        return true;\n    if (a.x - center.x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x &gt;= 0)\n        return false;\n    if (a.x - center.x == 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x == 0) {\n        if (a.y - center.y &gt;= 0 || b.y - center.y &gt;= 0)\n            return a.y &gt; b.y;\n        return b.y &gt; a.y;\n    }\n\n    // compute the cross product of vectors (center -&gt; a) x (center -&gt; b)\n    int det = (a.x - center.x) * (b.y - center.y) - (b.x - center.x) * (a.y - center.y);\n    if (det &lt; 0)\n        return true;\n    if (det &gt; 0)\n        return false;\n\n    // points a and b are on the same line from the center\n    // check which point is closer to the center\n    int d1 = (a.x - center.x) * (a.x - center.x) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);\n    int d2 = (b.x - center.x) * (b.x - center.x) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);\n    return d1 &gt; d2;\n}\n\nThis needs porting to performant Rust, so let's crack on.\nMore junk\nFirst, though, we need some supporting code.\nLet's say we define a Triangle with three Points like this:\nstruct Triangle {\n  p1: Point,\n  p2: Point,\n  p3: Point,\n}\n\nWhere Point is:\nstruct Point {\n  x: i32,\n  y: i32,\n}\n\nWe need a way to create triangles, and a way to get a triangle with all of its points sorted in\nclockwise order. Thus:\nimpl Triangle {\n    pub fn new(p1: Point, p2: Point, p3: Point) -&gt; Self {\n        Triangle { p1, p2, p3 }\n    }\n\n    pub fn sorted_clockwise(&amp;self) -&gt; Self {\n        let mut points = [self.p1, self.p2, self.p3];\n\n        let center = self.bounding_box().center();\n\n        points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise(*a, *b, center));\n\n        let [p1, p2, p3] = points;\n\n        Self::new(p1, p2, p3)\n    }\n}\n\nNotice the sort_clockwise function buried in there? That's what we'll focus on.\n\nNote: I'm getting the triangle's bounding box and using its center instead of finding the true\ntriangle \"center of gravity\" here - it's fast, and good enough for the purposes I need this method\nfor.\n\nStraight port from C/C++ to Rust\nThis is a syntax port of the original code to Rust. Pretty straightforward.\nfn sort_clockwise_c_port(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -&gt; bool {\n    if a.x - center.x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x &lt; 0 {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if a.x - center.x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x &gt;= 0 {\n        return false;\n    }\n    if a.x - center.x == 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x == 0 {\n        if a.y - center.y &gt;= 0 || b.y - center.y &gt;= 0 {\n            return a.y &gt; b.y;\n        }\n        return b.y &gt; a.y;\n    }\n\n    // compute the cross product of vectors (center -&gt; a) x (center -&gt; b)\n    let det = (a.x - center.x) * (b.y - center.y) - (b.x - center.x) * (a.y - center.y);\n    if det &lt; 0 {\n        return true;\n    }\n    if det &gt; 0 {\n        return false;\n    }\n\n    // points a and b are on the same line from the center\n    // check which point is closer to the center\n    let d1 = (a.x - center.x) * (a.x - center.x) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);\n    let d2 = (b.x - center.x) * (b.x - center.x) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);\n\n    d1 &gt; d2\n}\n\nThere's not much to mention here other than the fact we're still returning a bool. This needs to\nbe wrapped in a match to be usable by sort_unstable_by in Triangle::sorted_clockwise:\npoints.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| {\n    let order = sort_clockwise(*a, *b, center);\n\n    match order {\n        true =&gt; Ordering::Greater,\n        false =&gt; Ordering::Less\n    }\n});\n\nChanging to use Ordering\nThe above code doesn't feel very Rust-like, but we'll try and fix that better in a bit. For now\nthough, one good cleanup to make is to stop returning a bool and return an Ordering directly:\nfn sort_clockwise_use_ordering(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -&gt; Ordering {\n    if a.x - center.x &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x &lt; 0 {\n        return Ordering::Greater;\n    }\n    if a.x - center.x &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x &gt;= 0 {\n        return Ordering::Less;\n    }\n    if a.x - center.x == 0 &amp;&amp; b.x - center.x == 0 {\n        if a.y - center.y &gt;= 0 || b.y - center.y &gt;= 0 {\n            return a.y.cmp(&amp;b.y);\n        }\n        return b.y.cmp(&amp;a.y);\n    }\n\n    // Compute the cross product of vectors (center -&gt; a) x (center -&gt; b)\n    let det = (a.x - center.x) * (b.y - center.y) - (b.x - center.x) * (a.y - center.y);\n\n    match det.cmp(&amp;0) {\n        Ordering::Less =&gt; Ordering::Greater,\n        Ordering::Greater =&gt; Ordering::Less,\n        Ordering::Equal =&gt; {\n            // Points a and b are on the same line from the center. Check which point is closer to\n            // the center.\n            let d1 = (a.x - center.x) * (a.x - center.x) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);\n            let d2 = (b.x - center.x) * (b.x - center.x) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);\n\n            d1.cmp(&amp;d2)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThat's better! In terms of style, I'm happy with where this is at so I won't change it any futher.\nPerformance-wise, though, surely we can tune it some more?\nPerformance tuning\nFirst, one of the simplest optimisations is present in the original code: don't do work you don't\nhave to! For example, the det variable is only computed if the function falls through to where\nit's needed.\nNext are some attempts I made at optimising this code a bit better.\nHoist some comparisons\nRecomputing the same thing a few times seems pointless, so I'll hoist the two negations into the\nvariables d_ax and d_bx for reuse.\nfn sort_clockwise_hoisted_comparisons(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -&gt; Ordering {\n    let d_ax = a.x - center.x;\n    let d_bx = b.x - center.x;\n\n    if d_ax &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; d_bx &lt; 0 {\n        return Ordering::Greater;\n    }\n    if d_ax &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; d_bx &gt;= 0 {\n        return Ordering::Less;\n    }\n    if d_ax == 0 &amp;&amp; d_bx == 0 {\n        if a.y - center.y &gt;= 0 || b.y - center.y &gt;= 0 {\n            return a.y.cmp(&amp;b.y);\n        }\n        return b.y.cmp(&amp;a.y);\n    }\n\n    // Compute the cross product of vectors (center -&gt; a) x (center -&gt; b)\n    let det = (d_ax) * (b.y - center.y) - (d_bx) * (a.y - center.y);\n\n    match det.cmp(&amp;0) {\n        Ordering::Less =&gt; Ordering::Greater,\n        Ordering::Greater =&gt; Ordering::Less,\n        Ordering::Equal =&gt; {\n            // Points a and b are on the same line from the center. Check which point is closer to\n            // the center.\n            let d1 = (d_ax) * (d_ax) + (a.y - center.y) * (a.y - center.y);\n            let d2 = (d_bx) * (d_bx) + (b.y - center.y) * (b.y - center.y);\n\n            d1.cmp(&amp;d2)\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nUse .cmp and Ordering tricks\nWe've hoisted some calculations, but we can also hoist some of the comparisons into cmp_ax and\ncmp_bx. This also lets us squash everything into one giant match block. I'm not sure if it's\neasier to read, but it sure is some juicy Pro Rust™.\nfn sort_clockwise_big_match(a: Point, b: Point, center: Point) -&gt; Ordering {\n    let d_ax = a.x - center.x;\n    let d_bx = b.x - center.x;\n\n    let cmp_ax = d_ax.cmp(&amp;0);\n    let cmp_bx = d_bx.cmp(&amp;0);\n\n    match (cmp_ax, cmp_bx) {\n        // d_ax &gt;= 0 &amp;&amp; d_bx &lt; 0\n        (Ordering::Greater, Ordering::Less) | (Ordering::Equal, Ordering::Less) =&gt; {\n            Ordering::Greater\n        }\n        // d_ax &lt; 0 &amp;&amp; d_bx &gt;= 0\n        (Ordering::Less, Ordering::Greater) | (Ordering::Less, Ordering::Equal) =&gt; Ordering::Less,\n        // d_ax == 0 &amp;&amp; d_bx == 0\n        (Ordering::Equal, Ordering::Equal) if a.y - center.y &gt;= 0 || b.y - center.y &gt;= 0 =&gt; {\n            a.y.cmp(&amp;b.y)\n        }\n        (Ordering::Equal, Ordering::Equal) =&gt; b.y.cmp(&amp;a.y),\n        _ =&gt; {\n            // Compute the cross product of vectors (center -&gt; a) x (center -&gt; b)\n            let det = (d_ax) * (b.y - center.y) - (d_bx) * (a.y - center.y);\n\n            match det.cmp(&amp;0) {\n                Ordering::Less =&gt; Ordering::Greater,\n                Ordering::Greater =&gt; Ordering::Less,\n                Ordering::Equal =&gt; {\n                    // Points a and b are on the same line from the center.

There's a lot of\nrhetoric in Rust optimisation articles about idiomatic code allowing for better optimisations, but\nit doesn't seem to apply in this case.\nI don't show it here because it'd make the article too long, but I benchmarked a few other triangles\nwith different properties, and all are sorted at pretty much the same speed.\nIf you're interested, here's the bench code:\nuse core::cmp::Ordering;\nuse criterion::*;\nuse embedded_graphics::{geometry::Point, prelude::*, primitives::*};\n\nfn sort_points(c: &amp;mut Criterion) {\n    let mut group = c.benchmark_group(\"sort clockwise\");\n\n    let triangle = Triangle::new(\n        Point::new(100, 100),\n        Point::new(50, 130),\n        Point::new(20, 20),\n    );\n\n    let center = triangle.bounding_box().center();\n\n    group.bench_function(\"c port\", |b| {\n        b.iter(|| {\n            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];\n            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| {\n                let is_greater = sort_clockwise_c_port(*a, *b, center);\n\n                if is_greater {\n                    Ordering::Greater\n                } else {\n                    Ordering::Less\n                }\n            });\n        })\n    });\n\n    group.bench_function(\"use ordering\", |b| {\n        b.iter(|| {\n            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];\n            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_use_ordering(*a, *b, center));\n        })\n    });\n\n    group.bench_function(\"use ordering stable sort\", |b| {\n        b.iter(|| {\n            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];\n            points.sort_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_use_ordering(*a, *b, center));\n        })\n    });\n\n    group.bench_function(\"use ordering large set\", |b| {\n        b.iter(|| {\n            let mut points = [\n                Point::new(30, 40),\n                Point::new(20, 10),\n                Point::new(3, 28),\n                Point::new(118, 130),\n                Point::new(5, 8),\n                Point::new(58, 70),\n                Point::new(28, 60),\n                Point::new(10, 20),\n                Point::new(8, 40),\n                Point::new(60, 50),\n                Point::new(18, 30),\n                Point::new(78, 90),\n                Point::new(120, 110),\n                Point::new(80, 70),\n            ];\n            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_use_ordering(*a, *b, center));\n        })\n    });\n\n    group.bench_function(\"hoisted comparisons\", |b| {\n        b.iter(|| {\n            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];\n            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_hoisted_comparisons(*a, *b, center));\n        })\n    });\n\n    group.bench_function(\"big match\", |b| {\n        b.iter(|| {\n            let mut points = [triangle.p1, triangle.p2, triangle.p3];\n            points.sort_unstable_by(|a, b| sort_clockwise_big_match(*a, *b, center));\n        })\n    });\n}\n\ncriterion_group!(sort, sort_points);\ncriterion_main!(sort);\n\n\nPolygons\nWhat's the performance like for shapes with more than three points (i.e. polygons)?

The above\nbenchmark with 14 points sorts in about 140ns, or roughly 10ns per point. This will be overhead in\nthe sorting algorithm, as the sort function itself has a fixed input size.\nFinal result\nNow triangle points are correctly ordered!\n\n\nNotice the order of P1, P2 and P3 changes to keep the outside edge on the left of each line.\nThe only point that is moved between the two screenshots is P2 in the first (becoming P3).\nConclusion\nSo, which version is best? Considering they all have about the same performance, I went with\nsort_clockwise_use_ordering. I think it offers a good balance between readability and performance\n(by being basically the same as the naive bool C port). If the other methods improved performance\na large amount, I might've gone with the Pro Rust™ nested match with guards, but it's certainly\nnot easily read.\n\nPerformance stuff is always worth checking if you're not sure! It's also pretty simple with\ncriterion doing most of the heavy lifting.\nThat said, always take microbenchmarks with a grain of salt. In this case, that is even more\nrelevant as architecture differences between the target ARMv7 CPUs embedded-graphics is designed for\nand the beefy x64 the benchmarks are running on may have vastly different performance profiles.\nIdeally, benchmark on your target hardware if you can.\nThe final benchmark iteration time is about 10ns on my desktop. This post only discusses part of the\nfinal algorithm, so it does add up, but for now there are bigger fish to fry...\nAnother thing to do would be to look at the generated assembly. This might be important for\noptimising on ARM targets without being able to run benches on the target hardware, but I'll uhh\nleave that as an exercise for the reader because I can barely read assembly as it is, let alone grok\nthe performance of individual instructions.\n\nIf you got this far, thanks for reading! If you need a fast, featureful, flexible, easy to use\ngraphics library for your no-std environment, consider using\nembedded-graphics for your next project.

You can check the winding of any polygon with only the first 3 points using a cross product.— Nicholas Wilcox (@redbluemonkey) July 26, 2020 \nI might need a full sort for polygons, but with a focus on triangles right now this sounded like a\ngood idea to investigate. Am I being nerd-sniped? Hmm.\nHere's the new code as a method on the Triangle struct we defined\npreviously:\nimpl Triangle {\n    // ...\n\n    /// Create a new triangle with points sorted in a clockwise direction.\n    pub fn sorted_clockwise(&amp;self) -&gt; Self {\n        let Self { p1, p2, p3 } = self;\n\n        let determinant = -p2.y * p3.x + p1.y * (p3.x - p2.x) + p1.x * (p2.y - p3.y) + p2.x * p3.y;\n\n        match determinant.cmp(&amp;0) {\n            // Triangle is wound CCW. Swap two points to make it CW.\n            Ordering::Less =&gt; Self::new(p2, p1, p3),\n            // Triangle is already CW, do nothing.\n            Ordering::Greater =&gt; *self,\n            // Triangle is colinear. Sort points so they lie sequentially along the line.\n            Ordering::Equal =&gt; {\n                let (p1, p2, p3) = sort_yx(p1, p2, p3);\n\n                Self::new(p1, p2, p3)\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nThe determinant calculation is an optimised version of the formula presented\nhere. It's actually the\ndoubled area of the triangle where counter-clockwise triangles produce negative values. This\nbehaviour is useful because we can just swap two of the triangle's points to make it clockwise if\nthe result is negative.\nIf the determinant is zero, the triangle is colinear. In this instance, we'll sort the triangle's\npoints in ascending Y then X direction. This ensures the points always lie on the single line in\norder.\nThe sort_yx function above is implemented like this:\nfn sort_two_yx(p1: Point, p2: Point) -&gt; (Point, Point) {\n    // If p1.y is less than p2.y, return it first.

Change the mode!"},"https://wapl.es/rust/2022/07/03/const-builder-pattern.html/":{"body":"During the creation of EtherCrab, a pure-Rust EtherCAT\nmaster, one of the core structs in the crate started growing quite a few const generic parameters.\nHere's a reduced example of what I'm talking about:\nstruct Client&lt;const N: usize, const D: usize, const TIMEOUT: u64&gt; {\n    foo: [u8; N],\n    bar: [u8; D],\n    idx: u8\n}\n\nThere are/will be a few more parameters in the future, but this is already pretty unwieldy, so let's\nfix that.\nBut first: a normal builder\nSkip this section if you already know what the builder pattern is :)\nFor structs with many different parameters, you'll often see the builder pattern used in Rust\ncrates, for example in embedded-graphics:\nlet style = PrimitiveStyleBuilder::new()\n    .stroke_width(5)\n    .stroke_color(Rgb565::RED)\n    .fill_color(Rgb565::GREEN)\n    .build();\n\nlet radii = CornerRadiiBuilder::new()\n    .top_left(Size::new(5, 6))\n    .top_right(Size::new(7, 8))\n    .bottom_right(Size::new(9, 10))\n    .bottom_left(Size::new(11, 12))\n    .build();\n\nRoundedRectangle::new(Rectangle::new(Point::new(5, 5), Size::new(40, 50)), radii)\n\nThe builder allows the final struct (RoundedRectangle in this case) to have private fields, but\nmore importantly helps disambiguate passing random values for various fields. Let's take a look at\nwhat creating a PrimitiveStyle, created by PrimitiveStyleBuilder in the example above, would\nlook like without a builder:\n// Ordered as above: stroke width, stroke colour, fill colour\nlet style = PrimitiveStyle::new(5, Rgb565::RED, Rgb565::GREEN);\n\nNow, assuming we don't have nice inlay hints in our editor showing the argument names, how do we\nknow what the three magic arguments correspond to? We don't! We can take a guess, but that's a\nrecipe for disaster. Hopefully this example demonstrates the added safety and readability that\nbuilders provide.\nA fantastic extra feature also falls out of the builder pattern: we can have sensible defaults\nwithin the builder, meaning the programmer doesn't have to specify all field values every time. In\ncontrast, to support this in the non-builder API it sucks even more:\n// Use the default fill colour but override everything else\nlet style = PrimitiveStyle::new(Some(5), Some(Rgb565::RED), None);\n\nConst builders\nWe need a slightly different pattern with a builder for const parameters. Let's see what a first\nincarnation looks like.\nstruct ConstBuilder&lt;const N: usize, const D: usize, const TIMEOUT: u64&gt;;\n\nimpl&lt;const N: usize, const D: usize, const TIMEOUT: u64&gt; ConstBuilder&lt;N, D, TIMEOUT&gt; {\n    const fn with_n&lt;const N_SET: usize&gt;(self) -&gt; ConstBuilder&lt;N_SET, D, TIMEOUT&gt; {\n        ConstBuilder::&lt;N_SET, D, TIMEOUT&gt;\n    }\n\n    const fn with_d&lt;const D_SET: usize&gt;(self) -&gt; ConstBuilder&lt;N, D_SET, TIMEOUT&gt; {\n        ConstBuilder::&lt;N, D_SET, TIMEOUT&gt;\n    }\n\n    const fn with_timeout&lt;const TIMEOUT_SET: u64&gt;(self) -&gt; ConstBuilder&lt;N, D, TIMEOUT_SET&gt; {\n        ConstBuilder::&lt;N, D, TIMEOUT_SET&gt;\n    }\n\n    const fn build(self) -&gt; Client&lt;N, D, TIMEOUT&gt; {\n        Client {\n            foo: [0x00; N],\n            bar: [0x00; D],\n            idx: 0,\n        }\n    }\n}\n\nIf your first thought is \"wow, that's quite verbose with all the consts there!\" you are absolutely\ncorrect and I agree with you. But the usage isn't so bad:\nlet thing = ConstBuilder::new()\n    .with_n::&lt;16&gt;()\n    .with_d::&lt;32&gt;()\n    .with_timeout::&lt;30_000&gt;()\n    .build();\n\nThat almost looks like a normal builder!\nDefaults\nBut where does new() come from? This took me a few tries to figure out. Here's the first solution\nI reached for:\nconst fn new() -&gt; Self {\n    Self\n}\n\nAh...\n   |\n61 |     let thing = ConstBuilder::new()\n   |                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ cannot infer the value of const parameter `N`\n\nAlright then, how about...\nconst fn new() -&gt; ConstBuilder&lt;N, D, TIMEOUT&gt; {\n    ConstBuilder::&lt;N, D, TIMEOUT&gt;\n}\n\nnah, same error. Note that the error also percolates to D, then TIMEOUT if we define N.\nWe need two things out of this new() method;\n\nNo errors please\nAn ability to initialise the builder with some default values\n\nThe solution to both these points is thankfully pretty simple: We must define another impl block\nbut this time, we'll use concrete values:\nimpl ConstBuilder&lt;16, 16, 30_000&gt; {\n    const fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Self\n    }\n}\n\nThis works, but I admit it does replicate the magic values issue we had with the\nlet style = PrimitiveStyle::new(5, Rgb565::RED, Rgb565::GREEN);-style API above. That said, the\ndefaults are more likely to be contained within the crate or module, so they're not exposed to the\nuser to make mistakes with - only you, great author, can mess your crate up ;).\nThat said, we can guard against this a little bit better by giving some names to the default values:\nconst DEFAULT_N: usize = 16;\nconst DEFAULT_D: usize = 16;\nconst DEFAULT_TIMEOUT: u64 = 30_000;\n\nimpl ConstBuilder&lt;DEFAULT_N, DEFAULT_D, DEFAULT_TIMEOUT&gt; {\n    const fn new() -&gt; Self {\n        Self\n    }\n}\n\nThis doesn't prevent reordering defaults of the same type, but perhaps it goes a little way to\nmaking the code less error prone.\nThe whole lot\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with this builder pattern. I doubt I'm the first to discover it, but it\nwas a bit of a eureka moment for me and I thought it interesting enough to share.

There's a function, createEvent,\nthat returns an object with a dynamically generated UUID value in it. It also includes the current\ntimestamp. This is great from the programmer's point of view as there's no need to wire up these\nvalues manually, but it sucks for unit tests because the values always change! The solution is to\nuse\ndefault parameters\nto keep the ergonomics of a clean public API, but still support unit testing and special cases\ngracefully.\nLet's say we have the following function:\nimport { v4 } from \"uuid\";\n\nfunction createUser(name: string, email: string) {\n  return {\n    name,\n    email,\n    id: v4(),\n    created_at: new Date().toISOString(),\n  };\n}\n\nPretty standard. Calling it is ergonomic:\nconst user = createUser(\"Bobby Beans\", \"bobby@beans.com\");\n\nGreat, my ground-breaking code goes live yet again. Or would if I had any unit tests! Fine. Bloody\nreview process.\nUnit testing\nUnit testing this function should be pretty easy, right? I'll just write something like this (using\nMocha and Chai):\ndescribe(\"Create user\", () =&gt; {\n  it(\"Creates a user with ID and created at fields\", () =&gt; {\n    const expected = {\n      name: \"Bobby Beans\",\n      email: \"bobby@beans.com\",\n      id: \"33713144-3a28-4eac-ba0b-f626489d3993\",\n      created_at: \"2018-01-02T03:04:05\",\n    };\n\n    const created = createUser(\"Bobby Beans\", \"bobby@beans.com\");\n\n    expect(created).to.deep.equal(expected);\n  });\n});\n\nA pretty contrived test, but good enough for the purposes of this post. Naturally, it fails.\nBecause UUIDs are unique, the value returned by createUser will be different every time, failing\nour expect() equality check. Similarly, the timestamp returned is always the current timestamp\nso that's of no use to compare against either.\nOne solution to this problem is to only check that some fields are returned, perhaps just name\nand email, but this makes the unit test even less useful. Let's fix it properly by using default\nparameters in our createUser function:\nimport { v4 } from \"uuid\";\n\nfunction createUser(\n  name: string,\n  email: string,\n  _uuid = v4,\n  _timestamp = () =&gt; new Date().toISOString()\n) {\n  return {\n    name,\n    email,\n    id: _uuid(),\n    created_at: _timestamp(),\n  };\n}\n\nWhen the function is called normally as createUser(name, email), _uuid and _timestamp are left\nundefined, so use their default values as used. These are v4 (from uuid) and a function that\nreturns the current timestamp. This doesn't change the normal interface to this function, however\nnow we can do much nicer stuff with our test:\ndescribe(\"Create user\", () =&gt; {\n  it(\"Creates a user with ID and created at fields\", () =&gt; {\n    const id = \"33713144-3a28-4eac-ba0b-f626489d3993\";\n    const created_at = \"2018-01-02T03:04:05\";\n\n    const expected = {\n      name: \"Bobby Beans\",\n      email: \"bobby@beans.com\",\n      id,\n      created_at,\n    };\n\n    const created = createUser(\n      \"Bobby Beans\",\n      \"bobby@beans.com\",\n      () =&gt; id,\n      () =&gt; created_at\n    );\n\n    expect(created).to.deep.equal(expected);\n  });\n});\n\nThe above changes hardcode the id and created_at values, allowing the test to do a deep\ncomparison on the whole returned object. This simplifies the test code, and improves coverage by\nensuring that every field returned is what we expect. Adding tests like this to a well-typed\nTypescript codebase should lead to more robust code and fewer (hopefully no) errors in production.\nFingers crossed anyway.\nNow someone can approve my pull request. Hooray!\nCaveats\nThere's a somewhat major caveat to this method, and that's one of argument counts. What if I want to\nadd a third field password to my handy createUser function? That's easy enough, but now all the\nexisting code that uses createUser will error out. The _uuid argument is now being given a\nstring as input, which is of course not what we want it to do. Typescript will likely warn you in\nthis case, but maybe not. A solution I can think of is to pass all your arguments to the function as\nan object with overridable functions defined after:\nimport { v4 } from 'uuid';\n\nfunction createUser(\n  {\n    name\n    email\n  }: {\n    name: string,\n    email: string\n  },\n  _uuid = v4,\n  _timestamp = () =&gt; (new Date()).toISOString()\n) {\n  return {\n    name,\n    email,\n    id: _uuid(),\n    created_at: _timestamp()\n  }\n}\n\nNow adding password is as easy as extending the first arguments object, and the \"hidden\" test\nhelper arguments _uuid and _timestamp are left neatly alone. Personally I think this is safer\nand easier to reason about than positional string arguments, so take this as just another reason to\npass objects as function arguments.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/typescript/2018/12/10/default-arguments-for-cooler-testing.html/","title":"Default arguments for cooler testing"},"https://wapl.es/typescript/2018/12/10/typechecking-helper-functions-in-typescript.html/":{"body":"I've been working on toasting a lot of our tech debt at Repositive\nrecently. We use an event driven microservice architecture which has various benefits, but some\ndrawbacks concerning what data is sent where due in part to the liberal use of any in our\nTypescript codebases. During my refactoring rampage, I encountered some places where event objects\nwere missing fields or otherwise weren't being generated properly. To this end, I set out to create\na type-checked solution to this problem.\nWhat events look like to us\nFirstly, an event as seen on a Repositive-branded wire looks like this (prettified):\n{\n  \"id\": \"18efffd3-8b0d-48b4-bf3b-1e2d17a91822\",\n  \"data\": {\n    \"type\": \"some_namespace.SomeEventType\",\n    \"event_namespace\": \"some_namespace\",\n    \"event_type\": \"SomeEventType\",\n    \"some_field\": true,\n    \"some_other_field\": 100\n  },\n  \"context\": {\n    \"time\": \"2018-12-10T12:40:52Z\"\n  }\n}\n\nThere's an ID field, a data payload and a context which holds (amongst other things IRL) and\nevent creation time.\nInside data, there are three fields common to all events which denote which type of event it\nis:\n\nevent_namespace - the namespace (domain) from which this event was emitted (accounts,\nproducts, etc).\nevent_type - the type of this event, used to define what the payload should contain when\nconsuming the event.\ntype - legacy field that contains both the above pieces of information.\n\nThe rest of the fields inside data are freeform and can be anything, including nested objects, as\nlong as the object keys type, event_type and event_namespace are not used.\nTypescript implementation\nIn Typescript, we define some types to use when handling events like the above. There's one that\nholds the three common event type fields EventData:\ninterface EventData {\n  type: string;\n  event_namespace: string;\n  event_type: string;\n}\n\nThis forms the core of an event's payload. Next, there's a wrapping type called Event which is\nwhat the complete event object should look like:\ninterface Event&lt;D extends EventData&gt; {\n  id: string;\n  data: D;\n  context: { time: string };\n}\n\nAnd finally let's define the event given in the JSON example above:\ninterface BlogEvent extends EventData {\n  some_field: boolean;\n  some_other_field: number;\n}\n\nNote that I'm using string a lot here. You should probably create type aliases like\ntype Uuid = string;. It might not aid with format checking, but it will at least make clear to\nother programmers what the intent of that field is.\nA better idea might be to use io-ts which would let you do\nawesome things like validate your payloads at runtime using the type system!\nAnyway, now that those types are defined, events can be created that match the correct type\nsignature:\nimport { v4 } from \"uuid\";\n\nconst emit_this: Event&lt;BlogEvent&gt; = {\n  id: v4(),\n  data: {\n    type: \"some_namespace.SomeEventType\",\n    event_namespace: \"some_namespace\",\n    event_type: \"SomeEventType\",\n    some_field: true,\n    some_other_field: 100,\n  },\n  context: {\n    time: new Date().toISOString(),\n  },\n};\n\nThis isn't too bad. Fields in data can't be missed and, critically, the event metadata (type,\nevent_namespace and event_type) fields can't be typoed! Thanks Typescript!\nFirst attempt: lazy is dangerous\nThe above is alright I guess. At least the final event object is checked at compile time before\nserializing and sending/storing it. The problem is it's pretty verbose. Wouldn't it be nicer to have\na function that, given a data payload just makes us an event? This is what I came up with to\nsolve this problem the first time:\nimport { v4 } from 'uuid';\n\nexport function createEvent(\n  event_namespace: string,\n  event_type: string,\n  data: object\n): Event&lt;EventData&gt; {\n  return {\n    id: v4(),\n    data: {\n      ...data,\n      type: `${event_namespace}.${event_type}`,\n      event_type,\n      event_namespace,\n    },\n    context: { time: (new Date()).toISOString(),\n  };\n}\n\n\nNeat. Now the programmer doesn't have to care about the particular shape of the object, just some\nspecific fields. Usage looks like this:\nconst emit_this = createEvent(\"some_namespace\", \"SomeEventType\", {\n  some_field: true,\n  some_other_field: 100,\n});\n\nThis is obviously a lot cleaner. The programmer doesn't have to worry about the joined type field\nmatching event_namespace and event_type anymore, and the UUID and timestamp are automatically\ninserted in the right places. The event's shape will also always be correct. But there's a\nproblem...\nTypescript doesn't type check this properly! At least it didn't at the time of writing. For example,\nadding an explicit type still doesn't catch the incorrect spelling of some_namespace in the\nexample below:\nconst emit_this: Event&lt;BlogEvent&gt; = createEvent(\"potato\", \"SomeEventType\", {\n  some_field: true,\n  some_other_field: 100,\n});\n\nThis is more ergonomic, but is a step backward in the reliability of the system. Mistyped fields\nand events with missing keys were encountered in production when using the createEvent defined\nabove. This is pretty terrible. We should be pushing the programmer into the\npit of success!\nInto the pit - safely\nWhat createEvent needs is some actual, smart type checking. Issues arose when we decided to make\ncreateEvent construct the returned object from a few different fields in its arguments.\nTypechecking multiple arguments that get munged into a single object is pretty difficult (at least\nin Typescript) but can be done as you'll see next:\nimport { v4 } from \"uuid\";\n\ntype Omit&lt;T, K extends keyof T&gt; = Pick&lt;T, Exclude&lt;keyof T, K&gt;&gt;;\n\nexport function createEvent&lt;D extends EventData&gt;(\n  event_namespace: D[\"event_namespace\"],\n  event_type: D[\"event_type\"],\n  data: Omit&lt;D, \"event_namespace\" | \"event_type\" | \"type\"&gt;\n): Event&lt;D&gt; {\n  return {\n    id: v4(),\n    // Unsure why `as T` is required\n    // but doesn't stop type checking working\n    data: {\n      ...data,\n      type: `${event_namespace}.${event_type}`,\n      event_type,\n      event_namespace,\n    } as D,\n    context: {\n      time: new Date().toISOString(),\n    },\n  };\n}\n\nUsage looks like this:\nconst emit_this = createEvent&lt;BlogEvent&gt;(\"some_namespace\", \"SomeEventType\", {\n  some_field: true,\n  some_other_field: 100,\n});\n\nNearly identical to before, save for adding &lt;BlogEvent&gt; to the call signature. Our ergonomics are\npreserved, but now we get proper type checking! Any errors in any arguments will fail to compile.\nFor example:\n// Fails: typo in `SomeEventType`\nconst emit_this = createEvent&lt;BlogEvent&gt;(\"some_namespace\", \"SomeEventTpr\", {\n  some_field: true,\n  some_other_field: 100,\n});\n\n// Fails: missing `some_other_field`\nconst emit_this = createEvent&lt;BlogEvent&gt;(\"some_namespace\", \"SomeEventTpr\", {\n  some_field: true,\n});\n\nThis code couples the power of generics with Typescripts weird (but quite pleasant)\nstring-literals-are-types feature to enforce that, given an event payload, the string arguments\ngiven to createEvent must match whatever is defined for BlogEvent. The magic comes from using\nthe indexed access operator\n(you'll have to search through that page to find it) T[\"field_here\"] syntax to match the string\nliterals, and some gymnastics to implement an Omit type. This type states, in plainer words, every\nfield in D except type, event_namespace and event_type must be present in the passed\nobject. This is good for the programmer - if they pass in those fields in the data object, they get\noverwritten anyway, leading to unexpected behaviour. By denying them in the body, we enforce a more\ncorrect, safer way of creating events.\nThe code isn't as elegant as just providing a type, but now it means that our function properly\ntype checks the resulting object. This means no more typoed event name fields and no more\nmissing/mis-spelled data fields! This inelegance can also be tucked away in some library code,\nleaving just the nice interface. The only caveat with the above implementation that I've found so\nfar is that the programmer must explicitly provide the type, or typechecking won't be \"enabled\".\nThere's a compiler option - --noImplicitAny - which might help with this but I haven't tried it\nyet.\nTypescript is actually good if you don't slap anys everywhere and leverage its type system\nfully. People have a lot of strong opinions both ways about static type checking, but if it stops\nbroken stuff getting into production, then it absolutely should be another tool in your toolbox.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/typescript/2018/12/10/typechecking-helper-functions-in-typescript.html/","title":"Typechecking builder functions in Typescript"},"https://wapl.es/typescript/2019/03/14/xml-jsx-sitemaps-in-typescript.html/":{"body":"I maintain the Repositive website which uses React for the frontend and a\nserver that supports server side rendering for the speed and SEO benefits of SSR.

Like lots of companies, understanding what users do\nand how they interact with a product is to get good insight on. In this regard, people reinvent the\nlogging wheel with various krimskrams attached, me\nbeing no exception. What I want to show in this post is how to integrate an event logging framework\ninto a React/Redux application in a way that's scaleable and testable. Unit testable logging is\nimportant when the rest of the business relies heavily on the events and the data in them like many\ncompanies do.\ntl;dr: pass your logger to React's context to make logging from deeply nested components much\neasier.\nIn this article, I'm assuming you've got an existing React/Redux application, and want to integrate\nsome kind of event logging library into it.\nThe logging library\nLet's make a fake logging library that looks like this:\n// lib/logger.js\n\nclass Logger {\n  constructor() {\n    this.socket = new WebSocket(\"wss://events.example.com\");\n  }\n\n  send(eventName, eventData = {}) {\n    this.socket.send({\n      eventName,\n      payload: eventData,\n    });\n  }\n}\n\nexport default new Logger();\n\nThis could be anything, even something like Google Analytics or Firebase. How you log events and to\nwhere doesn't really matter as the logging code will be contained inside an action creator.\nRedux – Action creator\nAction creators in Redux can have side effects like making API calls or, in our case, logging\nsomething. We'll create a simple action creator like this:\n// actions/logger.js\n\nimport logger from '../lib/logger'\n\nexport const LOG_EVENT = 'LOG_EVENT'\n\nexport function logEvent(name, data❶ = {}) {\n\tlogger.send(name, data)\n\n\treturn❷ {\n\t\ttype: LOG_EVENT,\n\t\tname,\n\t\tdata,\n\t}\n}\n\n❶ Define a default empty object, so we don't have to worry about handling undefined or null values.\n❷ Returning something from this action creator isn't strictly necessary for just logging events\nusing the logger, but if you want to record those events in your Redux store, you need to return an\naction for the reducers to respond to.\nWe now have an action creator that, when called, will log an event over our pretend websocket-based\nlogging library. Let's hook it up to a button in React.\nIntegration with React (the bad way)\nThe simplest and perhaps obvious way is to pass down an event handler to the elment you want to log\nan event from. React encourages this pattern for handling other events, so why not logs? When an\nevent is fired, your code would handle that in the top level Redux-connected page component. We\ncould pepper Redux' connect() through our component tree, but that makes testing harder, which\nis the opposite of what we want to do. It also tightly couples our app to Redux instead of dealing\nwith plain old Javascript objects.\nThis following example is for a login page where we want to log an event when the submit button is\nclicked. Here, logging that event isn't too bad because we already have a click handler for the\nsubmit button. But what if we had a different component with no other props? In this case, we'd have\nto write a handleClick function in the top level component, and pass an onClick prop all the way\nthrough the component tree. This is noisy, boilerplate-y and error prone. In the next section, I'll\nshow a better way of doing this.\n// pages/Login.jsx\n\nimport React, { PureComponent } from 'react'\n\nimport { logEvent } from '../actions/logger'\n\nconst SubmitButton = ({ onClick, children }) =&gt; (\n\t&lt;button\n\t\tclassName=\"btn btn--submit\"\n\t\tonClick={onClick}\n\t&gt;\n\t\t{children}\n\t&lt;/button&gt;\n)\n\nconst LoginForm = ({ onSubmit, onChange }) =&gt; (\n\t&lt;form&gt;\n\t\t&lt;input\n\t\t\tonChange={onChange}\n\t\t\ttype=\"text\"\n\t\t\tname=\"email\"\n\t\t/&gt;\n\n\t\t&lt;input\n\t\t\tonChange={onChange}\n\t\t\ttype=\"password\"\n\t\t\tname=\"password\"\n\t\t/&gt;\n\n\t\t&lt;SubmitButton onClick={onSubmit}&gt;\n\t\t\tLog in\n\t\t&lt;/SubmitButton&gt;\n\t&lt;/form&gt;\n)\n\nclass LoginPage extends PureComponent {\n\thandleChange(e) {\n\t\t...\n\t}\n\n\thandleSubmit() {\n\t\tconst { dispatch } = this.props\n\n\t\tdispatch(logEvent('loginSubmit'))\n\t\tdispatch(login())\n\t}\n\n\trender() {\n\t\treturn (\n\t\t\t&lt;main&gt;\n\t\t\t\t&lt;header&gt;...&lt;/header&gt;\n\n\t\t\t\t&lt;LoginForm\n\t\t\t\t\tonChange={this.handleChange}\n\t\t\t\t\tonSubmit={this.handleSubmit}\n\t\t\t\t/&gt;\n\t\t\t&lt;/main&gt;\n\t\t)\n\t}\n}\n\nexport default connect(state =&gt; state)(LoginPage)\n\nIntegration with React (the good better way)\nA better way to handle this logging is to use React's\ncontext functionality. Context\nshould be used sparingly\nand its caveats like coupling global state, but in this case it can help us create a far cleaner\nlogging implementation. First, we need to make a context provider that will make the logger\navailable to all child components in our app:\n// components/LoggerProvider.jsx\n\nimport React, { PureComponent } from 'react'\n\nimport { logEvent } from '../actions/logger'\n\nclass LoggerProvider extends PureComponent {\n\t❶static childContextTypes = {\n\t\tlogEvent: PropTypes.func,\n\t}\n\n\t❷getChildContext = () =&gt; {\n\t\treturn {\n\t\t\tlogEvent: (eventName, eventData) =&gt; this.props.store.dispatch(logEvent(eventName, eventData)),\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\t// Pass through children verbatim\n\trender = () =&gt; this.props.children\n}\n\nexport default connect(() =&gt; {}❸)(LoggerProvider)\n\nHere we:\n❶ Define childContextTypes to allow child components to ask for logEvent using their\ncontextTypes property.\n❷ Make the definition of logEvent. In this case, it's a function that will be called like\ncontext.logEvent('foo', { bar: 'true '}) which matches the Redux action signature written earlier.\n❸ Don't need any state from the store, so we can just return an empty object.\nThis component won't work without a Redux store. We can add that by wrapping it in a Provider\ncomponent from react-redux. An example application might\nlook like this:\n// index.jsx\n\nimport React from \"react\";\n\nimport { Provider } from \"react-redux\";\n\nconst App = ({ store }) =&gt; (\n  &lt;Provider store={store}&gt;\n    &lt;LoggerProvider&gt;{/* Insert your router or page container component here */}&lt;/LoggerProvider&gt;\n  &lt;/Provider&gt;\n);\n\nMake sure LoggerProvider is a child of Provider. If it's the other way round, you won't be able\nto access the store. Now let's modify the &lt;SubmitButton /&gt; component we want to log events from to\ngive it access to context:\n// components/LoginButton.jsx\n\nimport PropTypes from 'prop-types'\n\nconst SubmitButton = ({ onClick, children }, { logEvent❶ }) =&gt; (\n\t&lt;button\n\t\tclassName=\"btn btn--submit\"\n\t\tonClick={onClick}\n\t&gt;\n\t\t{children}\n\t&lt;/button&gt;\n)\n\n❷SubmitButton.contextTypes = {\n\tlogEvent: PropTypes.func,\n}\n\nexport default SubmitButton\n\n❶ Stateless functional components access context through the second argument of the function\ndeclaration.\n❷ React requires you to explicitly mark which pieces of the context you want using\nComponent.contextTypes. In this case, just logEvent which is a function. If you don't add this,\nlogEvent will be undefined!\nAssuming your app uses LoggerProvider somewhere near the top of its component tree, you should now\nbe able to call context.logEvent which will dispatch a Redux action with the functionality\nprovided by LoggerProvider. This should work wherever this component is in the component tree.\nTesting with Mocha and Enzyme\nEasy testability is a very useful side-effect of using the context method. You could add spies and\nassertions around a Redux store, but this then requires you to store logged events in your store\nwhich you might not want to do (e.g. with third party logging libraries). It also leads to a much\nmore complex test harness involving Redux and a &lt;Provider&gt;.\nI'm using Mocha, Enzyme,\nChai and Sinon for this article, but this technique\nshould be applicable to most test environments.\nUsing context in a component comes with the caveat that a context obejct must be present in Enzyme\nunit tests. This can get a little frustrating and introduces some obtuse errors if one is not aware\nof the context requirement. However I think the benefits outweigh these extra steps. Context\ncan easily be passed into components,\nmaking it extremely simple to pass spies and catch logging calls.\nIt's not strictly necessary, but I'm going to use\nsinon-chai to make error messages a bit clearer.\nHere's our test:\n// test/components/SubmitButton.spec.js\n\nimport SubmitButton from \"../components/SubmitButton\";\n\ndescribe(\"&lt;SubmitButton /&gt;\", () =&gt; {\n  it(\"Calls the onClick event when clicked\", () =&gt; {\n    const clickSpy = spy();\n\n    const button = shallow(&lt;SubmitButton onClick={clickSpy}&gt;Submit&lt;/SubmitButton&gt;, {\n      context: { logEvent: () =&gt; {} },\n    });\n\n    button.simulate(\"click\");\n\n    expect(clickSpy).to.have.been.calledOnce;\n  });\n\n  it(\"Logs an event when clicked\", () =&gt; {\n    const logSpy = spy();\n\n    const button = shallow(&lt;SubmitButton onClick={() =&gt; {}}&gt;Submit&lt;/SubmitButton&gt;, {\n      context: { logEvent: logSpy },\n    });\n\n    button.simulate(\"click\");\n\n    expect(logSpy).to.have.been.calledWith(\"loginSubmit\", { foo: \"bar\", baz: \"quux\" });\n  });\n});\n\nWe've got two tests here:\n\n\nCalls the onClick event when clicked. Checks to make sure onSubmit() is called when the\nbutton is clicked. This isn't relevant to event log testing, it just shows another Enzyme test\nbeing used.\n\n\nLogs an event when clicked. Checks that logEvent was called, and with the correct arguments.\n.calledWith('loginSubmit', { foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux' }) should be replaced with whatever shape\nof event you're logging. In this example, it's hardcoded to\n('loginSubmit', { foo: 'bar', baz: 'quux' }).\n\n\nIf you've set everything up right, you should see something like this:\n  &lt;SubmitButton /&gt;\n    ✓ Calls the onClick event when clicked\n    ✓ Logs an event when clicked\n\n\n  2 passing (2ms\n\nHooray!\nConclusion\nReact's context can be pretty powerful when used sparingly. Here, I've presented an approach to\nevent collection that makes logging from deeply nested React nodes easier, simpler and more\ntestable. However, I think it's important to take multiple approaches to event logging depending on\nwhere the event needs to be fired from. If you can do it without using context, do that! You lose\nsome ability to test using a spy in your tests, but it makes component testing simpler with less\nconfiguration by not requiring a fake context. If you can log an event inside another action\ncreator, that's the best way to go if possible. If not, using a context provider leads to a more\nscalable approach for larger apps with deeply nested component trees.\n","id":"https://wapl.es/web/2017/09/21/analytics-events-with-redux-and-react.html/","title":"Logging analytics events in a testable way with React and Redux"},"https://wapl.es/workshop/2016/11/12/scraping-without-a-scraper.html/":{"body":"In between watching the rain and emptying all the shmoo out of my air compressor (long overdue), I\ndecided to try my hand at some impromptu scraping this weekend.

YMMV but if you're on a budget, I think you can get pretty good results without\neye wateringly expensive equipment.\n\nScraping started with a small triangular file. This will make most sensible machinists cringe, but\nit works quite well and removes material more quickly than a scraping tool which sped up the initial\nflattening significantly. After that, I moved on to using a lathe toolbit that had been ground into\nsome kind of external grooving tool before I got my hands on it.
