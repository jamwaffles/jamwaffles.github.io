I have a G&G P90 (in tan, in case you were wondering) and like many others suffer from the hicap
mags failing to feed. Half filling them kind of works, but the feed mechanism always seems to jam.
I've got a half solution here in this article. It doesn't completely fix the problem, but my hicaps
feed a lot more reliably now, particularly in semi-auto, than they did before.

This fix works by supergluing a couple of BBs into strategic places in the mag to agitate the BBs
and make them fall into the feed mechanism more reliably.

First, crack open your mag by unscrewing every sccrew you can find. The mag has an outer shell and
an inner box, both of which you'll need to open. None of the internals should spring out, take care
during this step.

## Stopping 'back jamming'

I had problems where BBs would roll back into the feed wheel and cause it to jam. I fixed this by
supergluing a BB into a spot in the mag like this:

The feed roller on the left rotates clockwise and **must** make sure the BB clears the spokes on the
well so it can turn freely. About half a BB's width between the spokes and your glued BB is what you
should aim for.

## Agitating BBs

This is perhaps the more effective mod, and it should ensure BBs are fed into the spoked feed wheel
better as they usually have a tendency to clump up from the spring pressure of the mag. I solved
this using half a BB glued to the pre-feed wheel.

I cut a BB in half with some sidecutters and filed it smooth on the bottom so glue would bond
better:

I then glued it near the center of the pre-feed wheel (gear on the right) like this:

Screw the mag back together (don't forget the filler hatch) and you should be good to go. It's quite
difficult to break a mag using this method as the BBs can be snapped or sanded out if necessary,
just don't glue any of the gears or wheels!

As with all stuff like this, your mileage may vary. This mod has worked out ok for me although I do
still get some jams which are cleared by shaking the mag back and forth or giving it a good whack on
the top. I take excellent care of my airsoft gear...
