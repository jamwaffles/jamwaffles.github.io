<h1>James Waples</h1>
<h2>Experienced Rust developer</h2>
<h2>Edinburgh, Scotland</h2>

<p>
  Hi, I'm James, a Rust, electronics and CNC enthusiast. I've been programming since I was around 10
  years old, first starting with 8 bit assembler, Visual Basic and C. I started my career at 18 with
  a PHP web development role and slowly moved towards the JavaScript/Typescript ecosystem as it grew
  around the popularity of libraries like React. My work now revolves around the wonderful Rust
  programming language, gladly using it both professionally and in open source to write high quality
  code in embedded environments.
</p>

<p>
  I'm motivated by interesting software problems, challenging optimisations, interesting performance
  debugging and making a polished product for people to use. I strongly believe we work best in a
  team, each of us adding to something greater than the sum of parts.
</p>

<p>
  I'm also interested in electronics. As it's naturally close to programming, being the hardware
  one's code runs on, it was a quick discovery after computers and has become a long running hobby,
  most recently in Rust on STM32.
</p>

<p>
  Melding electronics and programming lead me to discover the expensive yet fascinating world of DIY
  CNC machines, myself having built at least 5 of improving capabilities (and heft) over time.
</p>

<h1>Open source projects</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://github.com/ethercrab-rs/ethercrab"
      >https://github.com/ethercrab-rs/ethercrab</a
    >

    <p>
      EtherCrab is a pure-Rust EtherCAT master runtime born of the frustrations of working with
      existing C-based libraries. It's an interesting introduction to the world of industrial
      automation and German beaurocracy when applying for (and receiving) EtherCAT organisation
      membership.

    <p>
      Rust bindings and a high level API to allow writing Rust modules for the popular open source
      LinuxCNC motion controller.

    >

    <p>
      A graphics library for embedded applications using no dynamic allocation, with primitives,
      fonts and image support. I'm proud to say it has over 400,000 downloads and a vibrant
      community around it.

    <ul>
      <li>
        Work with another developer to architect and implement the company's new cloud application

      </li>

      <li>
        Ensure the application is compliance‐ready using an event sourcing paradigm to record the
        atomic history of actions against entities in the application. What PII and where it is
        stored is also taken into consideration to comply with the GDPR.
      </li>

      <li>
        Release the event sourcing machinery as an open source library for reuse in other
        applications and projects. Experiment and implement a granular but not too complex
        permission system for both the backend and frontend to ensure security but also clearly
        message to the user what they can and cannot do.
      </li>

      </li>
      <li>
        Evangelised Rust within the company, producing some data‐processing tools to work through

      <li>
        Scratch‐built a brand new platform after a pivot, using Rust with PostgreSQL as the backend
        API, and Typescript with React and Redux in the frontend.

      <li>
        Lead development on an in‐house, Docker and ECS‐based tool to automatically host multiple
        in‐development branches so new features can be tested in reproducible, isolated

      <li>
        Architect and maintain the TM Loans frontend webapp, again written with NodeJS and React. It

      </li>
      <li>
        An internal monitoring and toolbox application involving fetching data from various AWS APIs
        and displaying charts of data using D3. It also uses websockets for realtime communication.
